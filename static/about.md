<p class="lede">Hi, my name is Lucas K.T. Lee. I’m a technology enthusiast, recent <abbr>MBA</abbr> graduate, and private equity lawyer.</p>

I’m currently an associate in the inaugural class of the Alibaba Global Leadership Academy, a global general management development program at one of China’s most innovative internet companies, [Alibaba Group](http://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home/).

I graduated from [Wharton](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) with an <abbr>MBA</abbr>, majoring in finance. I interned at [Polymath Ventures](http://www.polymathv.com/) in Bogotá, Colombia, during the summer of 2015. At Polymath, my focus was on fundraising strategy and execution for their first venture capital investment fund vehicle and their portfolio companies.

Before Wharton, I was a private equity lawyer at a global private markets asset manager, [Partners Group](http://www.partnersgroup.com/), where I structured infrastructure, private equity, and real estate investments in Asia, built the firm’s Asia-Pacific legal team from 2010 to 2014, and worked on a number of other strategic projects including the firm's China expansion in 2013.

I graduated from the [University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au) with a major in Chinese Studies, graduated from [Sydney Law School](http://sydney.edu.au/law/) with highest honors, and am qualified as an attorney in the State of New York.

I read voraciously and eclectically. I write in long form (very often _extremely long form_) on this blog and in short form on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucasKTLee/). Sometimes, I write flash fiction, mostly in the science fiction or fantasy genres.

I take a lot of photographs, mostly in the landscape, city scape, and architecture genres, some of which can be found on [500px](https://500px.com/lucasktlee/). 

You can reach me at [l.lee@lucasktlee.com](mailto:l.lee@lucasktlee.com) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucasKTLee/), [Github](https://github.com/lucasktlee/), or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasktlee/).
