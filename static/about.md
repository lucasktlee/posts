<p class="lede">Hi, my name is Lucas K.T. Lee. I’m a technology enthusiast, recent <abbr>MBA</abbr> graduate, and “recovering” private equity lawyer.</p>

I’m currently an associate in the inaugural class of the [Alibaba Global Leadership Academy](https://agla.alibaba.com), a global general management and leadership development program at one of China’s most innovative internet companies, [Alibaba Group](http://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home/).

I graduated from [Wharton](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) with an <abbr>MBA</abbr>, majoring in [finance](https://fnce.wharton.upenn.edu/). During the summer of 2015, I interned at [Polymath Ventures](http://www.polymathv.com/), a company builder in Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, focused on building massively scalable companies targeting middle class needs in Latin America. At Polymath, my focus was on fundraising strategy and execution for their first venture capital investment fund vehicle and their portfolio companies.

Before Wharton, I was a private equity lawyer at a rapidly growing global private markets asset manager, [Partners Group](http://www.partnersgroup.com/), where I structured infrastructure, private equity, and real estate investments in Asia, built the firm’s Asia-Pacific legal team from 2010 to 2014, and worked on a number of other strategic projects including the firm's China expansion in 2013.

I graduated from the [University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au) with a major in Chinese Studies, graduated from [Sydney Law School](http://sydney.edu.au/law/) with highest honors, and qualified as an attorney in the State of New York.

I read voraciously and eclectically. I write in long form (very often _extremely long form_) on this blog and in short form on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucasKTLee/). Sometimes, I write flash fiction, mostly in the science fiction or fantasy genres.

I take a lot of photographs, mostly in the landscape, city scape, and architecture genres, a portfolio of which can be found on  [500px](https://500px.com/lucasktlee/). I love traveling to strange new places and getting into all manner of adventures, and have only two continents left to visit.
