<p class="lede">Hi, my name is Lucas K.T. Lee. I’m a technology enthusiast, former private equity lawyer, and current MBA student.</p>

Since August 2014, I have been a MBA candidate at [Wharton](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/mba/), where I am focusing on entrepreneurial management and finance. I am interning at [Polymath Ventures](http://www.polymathv.com/) in Bogotá, Colombia, for the summer of 2015. At Polymath, my focus is on fundraising strategy and execution for their portfolio companies and their first investment fund vehicle.

Before becoming a MBA candidate at Wharton, I was a private equity lawyer at a Swiss private equity firm, [Partners Group](http://www.partnersgroup.com/), where I structured infrastructure, private equity, and real estate investments in Asia, built the firm’s Asia-Pacific legal team from 2010 to 2014, and worked on a number of other strategic projects including the firm's China expansion in 2013. 

I graduated from the [University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au) with a major in Chinese Studies, graduated from [Sydney Law School](http://sydney.edu.au/law/) with highest honors, and am qualified as an attorney in the State of New York. 

I read voraciously and eclectically. I write in long form (very often _extremely long form_) on this blog and in short form on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucasKTLee/). I take [photographs](http://500px.com/LucasKTLee/), especially when traveling. Sometimes, I write flash fiction, mostly in the science fiction or fantasy genres.
