<p class="lede">I have been asked why I do not have a commenting system enabled on this blog. Even though <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> does not have built-in commenting functionality, it would not have been impossible to deploy a third party commenting system like <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> or <a href="https://muut.com/">Moot</a>. So why haven’t I done so?</p>

The answer is simple. I am not convinced that comments on most blogs make sense. I used to run blogs with comments enabled, way back in the infancy of blogs in 2002.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> I kept blogging—using various domain names—for a period of nearly six years (2002 – 2008). From this experience I came to a few conclusions:

1. Comments are used by a very **tiny minority** of the people who visit a blog. Yet, by their very nature, comments are frequently used by spambots and trolls, and impose a burden of moderation on the blog owner. On a pure cost-benefit analysis, it does not make sense. 
2. The vast majority of comments **add zero value** to the topic of the post. Most readers know that and will skip the comments. Thus, comments are made by a very tiny minority of readers, and read by an almost equally tiny minority. My posts are long enough already. Adding verbiage that does not add value to the discussion is a waste of bandwidth.
3. Comments allow **anonymity.** I have found that anonymity tends to encourage some of the worst aspects of human nature to emerge. This blog is like an online study, a place where I come to reflect and write about things that matter to me. I do not have the inclination to deal with badly behaved people in my online study; I encounter enough of that elsewhere, thank you very much. By contrast, if someone response using a tweet or on their own blog, it is associated with their online identity and tends to lead to more reasoned discussion. Or at least, their public persona is accountable for those statements.
4. Comments encourage **unconsidered responses.** A comment box is to an impassioned reader like a red flag to a bull. And this tends again to result in knee-jerk responses that either add no value (“I agree” or its ilk) or (“I think you’re a fucking idiot”). I enjoy considered responses, even when people disagree with what I may say. I always have. I find very little of it on display in most comments. 

So, here it is. If something I write makes you want to respond, here are two ways to do so:

1. **Write a response on your blog.** Let me know about it via email or a tweet, and I’ll definitely read it, and if I think appropriate I’ll respond. This is the best way to have a discussion.
2. **Write a response on [Twitter (@LucasKTLee)](https://twitter.com/LucasKTLee/).** This works best for shorter comments.
