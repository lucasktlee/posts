<p class="lede">One’s birthday is a time to reflect on the passage of time. It is a chance to see if age has indeed granted wisdom, or just added wrinkles.</p>

So, without further ado, and recognizing that life advice from someone who has yet to cross the venerable age of sixty is somewhat pretentious and likely to be wrong, here are thirty-five short, simple pieces of advice that my experience has taught me: 

1. There is only now. The future is an illusion, it does not exist and may never exist. The past is gone forever and can never be recovered.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> Live in the __now.__
2. Laugh at everything, because it’s __always funny.__<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> 
3. __Change,__ __uncertainty,__ and __death__ are the only three universal constants of life. Accept them.<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> 
4. You will regret the things you __did not do__ more than the things you __did.__ When life asks you to dance, <abbr title="Shut the Fuck Up">STFU</abbr> and __dance.__
5. Be __selective__ when deciding who you will spend time with. Prefer a handful of close friends over a hundred casual acquaintances.
6. Go out of your way to spend time with people who are __intelligent,__ __interesting__ and __driven.__ Your life will be better for it. 
7. If you are the __smartest person in the room,__ you’re in the __wrong room.__ When you’re in a room and everyone else is as smart or smarter than you are, then you’re in the __right room.__
8. Learn, and __never stop learning.__ 
9. Read _good_ hard science fiction. It [opens your mind to possibilities](http://lucasktlee.com/2015/05/14/why-i-read-science-fiction/).
10. Do __new things__ often, even when doing it makes you afraid. To __live__ is to be open to being afraid. 
11. Avoid __clutter,__ physical and mental. 
12. Eat healthily. Exercise. Get enough sleep. __Resilience__ is a blessing you never notice until it’s gone.
13. You are __not__ what you own.
14. __Do,__ or do not do. But don’t waste time talking about what you would do but never do.
15. Learn to say ___“No.”___ Life is too short to spend time doing things that you don’t really want to do. 
16. Have __clear goals__ for yourself, for every day, every week, every month, every year, and every decade.
17. In the immortal words of Sean Connery, “Losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.” __Fuck__ the prom queen/king.
18. Other people’s successes do not diminish you. __Don’t be jealous.__
19. Treat __material comforts__ without arrogance or apology. If they’re available, avail yourself of them. If they aren’t, don’t yearn for them.<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup>
20. Be very afraid of someone<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fref05">5</a></sup> who extrapolates a linear pattern in something. Most interesting things in the world are __non-linear.__
21. You do not need everyone to like you, and in fact not everyone will like you. Accept that and __move on.__ 
22. Life is too short to __stay in one place__ forever. 
23. Life is too short to drink poor quality alcohol. __Quality__ over quantity. _Always._
24. The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. __Be mindful__ of what you think about.
25. Little boys wear pre-tied bow ties. Be a man and __learn to tie a bow tie properly,__ if you haven’t already learned to do that.
26. __Fuck__ up. Make mistakes, glorious, amazing, new mistakes. If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not trying new things and pushing yourself to the limits and then bursting past those limits. 
27. __Serendipity__ matters a lot. Be open to the possibility that the things you planned may not happen, but something better will. 
28. Things __never__ go according to plan. 
29. Work __hard__ and aim to be __the best__ in the world at whatever you do. 
30. When you give someone a gift or do someone a favor, treat it as pure expenditure and __expect nothing in return.__ If he or she repays it, it is an unexpected pleasure.<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fref06">6</a></sup>
31. Be __awed__ by the sheer size of the universe, at least once in a while.
32. __Love:__ It will make you vulnerable. Accept that living and loving means opening yourself to being hurt. But the alternative is to become impervious to life.<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fref07">7</a></sup>
33. __Forgive:__ Yourself and others. 
34. Life will __break you,__ inevitably. You will know grief, pain, despair, and darkness. But it is only after knowing all of those that you can truly see __the beauty of the light.__
35. One of life’s surprising pleasures is watching someone grow and learn. __Be a mentor.__
