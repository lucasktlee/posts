<p class="lede">For my first blog post, it seems fitting that I situate this blog in its proper place, time, and purpose. After all, as Plato once wrote in his <cite>The Republic</cite>, the beginning is the most important part of a work.</p>

This blog emerged from a period of introspection and change spanning the two years from 2012 to 2014. 

On  December 17, 2013, I was admitted to the MBA class of 2016 at [Wharton](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/mba/), ending a year-long business school application process. In June, after spending three years in [law school](http://sydney.edu.au/law/) and six years as a transactional attorney specializing in private investment funds and corporate mergers and acquisitions, I left the legal profession. 

I’ll move from Singapore to the United States in July. 

On August 4, 2014, I’ll become a graduate student again, though in a field as diametrically opposed to my previous graduate degree as is possible. 

It seems fitting, therefore, to begin a new blog now. The next two years will be a time of growth, profound transformation, discovery, and camaraderie. 

So what will this blog be about? This blog is, first and foremost, a blog about my passions. I will be writing about technology and entrepreneurial ventures, particularly in the area of truly transformational technologies such as general artificial intelligence and machine learning, ubiquitous computing, smart dust, and augmented reality. I’ll also be blogging about the financing of innovation through venture capital and growth stage private equity investments. Finally, this blog will chronicle my business school and professional experiences.
