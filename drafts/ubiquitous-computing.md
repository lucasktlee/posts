<p class="lede">When I wrote my <a href="http://lucasktlee.com/2015/05/03/thoughts-on-disruptive-technologies-2015/">thoughts on disruptive technologies</a>, there was one disruptive technology I did not mention: ubiquitous computing. I did not mention this technology because it was <em>too</em> easy; we live in a world where the rudimentary forms of ubiquitous or pervasive computing already exist and have already begun to influence our lives. Yet, after talking about ubiquitous computing with a friend, there are some things I want to say about this disruptive technology.</p>

First, what is ubiquitous computing? At its core, ubiquitous computing is a paradigm in which a significant fraction of manmade objects (preferably all) have some degree (preferably a substantial degree) of computational ability and environmental awareness. At its height, ubiquitous computing shades into pervasive computing, where computing is so deeply integrated into everyday life that it “disappears” from conscious awareness: it just “is”, in the same way that  We can illustrate this with a simple thought experiment:
