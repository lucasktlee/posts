<p class="lede">When I wrote my <a href="http://lucasktlee.com/2015/05/03/thoughts-on-disruptive-technologies-2015/">thoughts on disruptive technologies</a>, there was one disruptive technology I did not mention: ubiquitous computing. I did not mention this technology because it was far <em>too</em> easy; we live in a world where rudimentary forms of ubiquitous or pervasive computing already exist and have already begun to influence our lives. Yet, after talking about ubiquitous computing with a friend, there are some things I want to say about this disruptive technology.</p>

First, what is ubiquitous computing? At its core, ubiquitous computing is a paradigm in which a significant fraction of manmade objects (preferably all) have some degree (preferably a substantial degree) of computational ability and environmental awareness. At its height, ubiquitous computing shades into pervasive computing, where computing is so deeply integrated into everyday life that it “disappears” from conscious awareness: it just “is”, in the same way that people living in the developed world now take electricity, hot and cold running water, and supermarket aisles stocked with produce from all around the world for granted. 

We can see the beginnings of ubiquitous computing in the form of technologies that have become increasingly commonplace in recent years: 

* Cars from [Mercedes-Benz](http://www.mbusa.com/), [BMW](http://www.bmw.com/), [Audi](http://audiusa.com/), [Lexus](http://www.lexus.com/), and [Tesla Motors](http://www.teslamotors.com/) now have a combination of sensors and sufficient machine intelligence to be able to help a driver keep the car in its lane, assist with parking the car, automatically adjust the highbeam to avoid blinding other drivers, and automatically brake if the car detects obstacles. 
* Software that anticipates user needs and 

## The building blocks of ubiquitous computing

Ubiquitous computing is not a monolithic technology. Rather, it is built from a number of components.
