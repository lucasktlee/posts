<p class="lede">Fund structuring is often complicated by the myriad rules and regulations promulgated by the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> and other tax authorities. It can, for the uninitiated fund sponsor, be a proliferation of unfamiliar acronyms and arcane section references: <abbr>CAI</abbr> <abbr>CFC</abbr>, <abbr>ECI</abbr>, <abbr>FIRPTA</abbr>, <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, <abbr>QEF</abbr>, Section 892, <abbr>UBIT</abbr>, <abbr>UBTI</abbr>&#8230; What do these acronyms and section references mean?</p>

More pertinent, why should a fund sponsor care?

The short answer, is “because prospective limited partners care”. A fund’s tax structuring is often the subject of fairly extensive due diligence and negotiation by prospective limited partners, and in extreme situations where the fund sponsor cannot accommodate a prospective investor’s tax structuring requirements can result in that investor declining to make an investment. It can also affect both the fund sponsor’s choice of jurisdiction to organize the fund as well as the structure of the fund. As such, it behoves a shrewd fund sponsor to take the time to understand the effects of the different tax treatment accorded to certain categories of prospective limited partners, and some of the common solutions used by fund sponsors and their counsel.

Before we embark on this somewhat torturous journey through the complications of the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Code">IRC</abbr>, I must first address a few preliminary matters, lest this journey become lost as Odysseus was, after Troy. 

The first thing to do is to narrow our focus. I will discuss only the U.S. federal income tax treatment of U.S. and non-U.S. investors in a <abbr title="private equity">PE</abbr>/<abbr title="venture capital">VC</abbr> fund that invests in portfolio companies in the U.S. and outside the U.S. I will not discuss <abbr title="Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act">FIRPTA</abbr>, since that is primarily an issue with companies that have real property interests. I will not discuss the effects of <abbr title="Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act">FATCA</abbr> on fund structuring. I will also not discuss any other country’s tax regime on investment funds and their investors. 

Second, we must understand how the different rules promulgated by the <abbr>IRS</abbr> has divided limited partners into four broad categories: 

* **U.S. tax-exempt investors:** The <abbr>IRS</abbr> prescribes a fairly long list of entities that qualify as a tax-exempt organization, which I will not enumerate in toto here. These include corporations organized under an Act of Congress and that have been explicitly exempted from federal income taxes,<sup><a href="fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary organizations,<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> chambers of commerce,<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> social and recreational clubs,<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup> political organizations,<sup><a href="fref05" id="fref05">5</a></sup> farmers’ cooperatives,<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fref06">6</a></sup> private foundations,<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fref07">7</a></sup>, federal, state, and local governmental plans,<sup><a href="#fn08" id="fref08">8</a></sup> and employee benefit plans.<sup><a href="#fn09" id="fref09">9</a></sup>
* **U.S. taxable investors:** Broadly speaking, taxable investors in the United States should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any U.S. investor that cannot be categorized as a U.S. tax-exempt organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 
* **Foreign tax-exempt investors:** Per the well-established principle of sovereign immunity, foreign governments, their political subdivisions, and their controlled entities are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Foreign tax-exempt organizations are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Certain international organizations designated by executive orders are exempt from taxes on all U.S. source income.
* **Foreign taxable investors:** Like their American counterparts, foreign taxable investors should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any foreign investor that cannot be categorized as a foreign government, tax-exempt organization, or designated international organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 

Each of these categories of investors have separate tax concerns that a fund sponsor must address through fund structuring or investment structuring. 

Third, we should categorize the portfolio investments of a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund into two broad categories: 

* **U.S. portfolio investments:** Businesses incorporated in the U.S. and having their principal places of business in the U.S. 
* **Foreign portfolio investments:** Businesses incorporated outside the U.S. and having their principal places of business outside the U.S.

Fourth, we should understand how a fund is typically structured, in the absence of any compelling tax structuring, in order to better understand how tax structuring for all these investors affects the basic structure. 

A typical, plain-vanilla <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund will be structured as a limited partnership (as shown in [Figure 1](#fig01)):

</figure>

I have previously mentioned the reasons why the limited partnership is the [preferred fund structure](http://lucasktlee.com/2014/08/28/introduction-to-private-equity-fund-terms/) for most <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds, and shall not repeat myself here. It suffices to note that most funds organized in Anglo-American common law jurisdictions will use a limited partnership as their default approach.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fref10">10</a></sup> 

## U.S. tax-exempt investors

U.S. tax-exempt investors are one of the largest investors in <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds. As their name implies, these investors are—as a general rule—not taxed on their share of a fund’s capital gains or ordinary income. The general rule is, however, subject to one significant exception: the U.S. federal government taxes the gross income of U.S. tax-exempt investors derived from commercial activities unrelated to their tax-exempt purpose, better known by its abbreviation, <abbr title="unrelated business taxable income">UBTI</abbr>. The U.S. tax-exempt investor must file a U.S. federal income tax return and pay U.S. federal income taxes (<abbr title="Unrelated Business Income Tax">UBIT</abbr>) on investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> regardless of whether the investor has received any distributions from those investments.

U.S. tax-exempt investors can incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> on investments in the U.S. and outside the U.S.; it does not matter where the 

A U.S tax-exempt investor that invests in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund can incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr> in one of three ways: 

1. Income from a trade or business
2. Income from debt-financed investments 
3. Transaction fees and advisory fees earned by the <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund from its operations

Before we go into the details of how fund sponsors can structure their fund to minimize the risk that U.S. tax-exempt investors incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr>, it is always instructive to understand _why_ Congress, in its—_ahem_—infinite wisdom, decided that it was necessary to enact legislation imposing this tax on U.S. tax-exempt investors. 

### A brief history of <abbr>UBTI</abbr>

Taxation of <abbr>UBTI</abbr> had its origins in the entry of non-profit organizations into commercial ventures. In 1924, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that because all of the income from commercial and investment activities conducted by a U.S. tax-exempt organization was used to support the organization’s tax-exempt purpose, such income was not subject to tax. Following this decision, numerous tax-exempt organizations began incorporating “feeder” corporations to operate commercial businesses—including hotels, cattle ranches, fruit orchards, textile mills, departmental stores, and real estate leasing businesses—that were unrelated to these organizations’ tax-exempt purposes. These feeder corporations distributed all of their profits to the tax-exempt owners to use for their tax-exempt purposes. The income from these feeder corporations was exempt from U.S. federal income tax. 

Commercial ventures owned by U.S. taxable investors, it must be said, were not sanguine about competition from commercial ventures owned by tax-exempt investors; they feared that competitors operated by tax-exempt organizations might undercut their prices or reinvest tax-free profits to expand more rapidly and thereby drive the taxable commercial ventures out of business. Congress and the Internal Revenue Bureau (the predecessor to the <abbr>IRS</abbr>) were concerned about both this unfair competition and the risk that the growth of such tax-exempt commercial ventures would inevitably shrink the tax base.

As a result of this concern, in 1954 Congress imposed a tax on <abbr>UBTI</abbr> generated by the commercial activities of U.S. tax-exempt organizations. 

### Income from a trade or business

<abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds are typically considered as “investment partnerships”<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fref11">11</a></sup> for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and are thus deemed not to be engaged in a trade or business. Thus, an investment in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund will not in itself result a U.S. tax-exempt investor incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr>. This is not to say, however, that a U.S. tax-exempt investor can never incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from its investment in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund. 

The most obvious way in which a U.S. tax-exempt investor in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund can incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr> is when the fund invests in a portfolio company that has been incorporated or organized as a flow-through entity (a partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr>) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The income earned by such a portfolio company is characterized as income from an active business, and retains that characterization in the hands of the <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund. If the fund is itself a flow-through entity—most funds are—then the limited partners of the fund will each receive a proportionate share of this income, which continues to retain its characterization as income from an active business. In the hands of a U.S. tax-exempt investor, this active income would result in the U.S. tax-exempt investor incurring <abbr>UBTI</abbr>.

<figure class="border m" id="fig02">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem) 51.2rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig02-s.png 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig02-m.png 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig02-s-@2x.png 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig02-m-@2x.png 1024w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig02-s.png" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 2:</span> Incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from an active business organized as a partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr></figcaption>
</figure>

This situation is more likely to occur when a U.S. tax-exempt investor invests in a <abbr>VC</abbr> fund: some startups are formed as <abbr>LLC</abbr>s rather than as corporations to avoid corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. That being said, it is still rare to see a <abbr>VC</abbr> fund invest in a flow-through entity; most <abbr>VC</abbr>s will require the startups they invest in to either be incorporated as a corporation<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fref12">12</a></sup> (i.e. not a flow-through entity) or convert from an <abbr>LLC</abbr> to a corporation prior to their investment. By contrast, <abbr>PE</abbr> funds seldom invest in portfolio companies that are treated as flow-through entities: most mature companies were either incorporated as a corporation from the start, or converted to a corporation at some point in the past. 

#### The solution

Most fund sponsors have traditionally structure their fund to minimize <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from a trade or business by using some form of “blocker corporation”. The blocker corporation is not a flow-through entity; rather, it is taxed as a corporation and reports and pays U.S. federal income tax on its share of the active income from the flow-through portfolio company. When this blocker corporation distributes the income it receives to its shareholders, the income is characterized as dividend income, which does not incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> unless the shares in the blocker corporation are [debt-financed](#incomefromdebtfinancedinvestments).

There are three main structures that can be used to minimize <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from flow-through entities:

* A blocker corporation between the fund and the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign taxable investors<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fref13">13</a></sup> ([Figure 3A](#fig03a))
* A blocker corporation between the flow-through portfolio company and the fund ([Figure 3B](#fig03b))
* A blocker corporation serving as either a parallel fund to the main fund or an <abbr title="Alternative Investment Vehicle">AIV</abbr> ([Figure 3C](#fig03c))

The choice of which structure to use will often involve judgment as to the likelihood that the fund will invest in investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> (and <abbr title="Effectively Connected Income">ECI</abbr>), and the likelihood of the fund incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr>. Determining the appropriate structure is an exercise best done with skilled tax counsel, taking into account the investment strategy that the fund sponsor intends to pursue and the likelihood that the fund’s portfolio investments will incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr>.

First, let us look at how a blocker corporation interposed between the investors and the fund would look: 

<figure class="border l" id="fig03a">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03a-s.png 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03a-m.png 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03a-s-@2x.png 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03a-l.png 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03a-m-@2x.png 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03a-l-@2x.png 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03a-s.png" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 3a:</span> Interposing a blocker corporation between the fund and the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign investors</figcaption>
</figure>

Interposing a blocker corporation (typically incorporated in a foreign, low or zero tax jurisdiction) between the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign taxable investors) and the fund will prevent the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign investors from incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr> and <abbr>ECI</abbr> from the fund’s investments in flow-through portfolio companies and debt-financed investments, respectively. These investors will not be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return solely because of their investment in the fund, since the blocker corporation will be the recipient of the income that would otherwise be <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>. 

In this structure, _all_ investments made by the fund—not just investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>—will be held through the blocker corporation. Given that the blocker corporation _is_ subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its U.S. sourced income, this structure is not the most tax efficient for the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign taxable investors.

From the perspective of the general partner, however, this structure offers one key advantage: the general partner’s carried interest is determined at the fund level, _before_ any taxes paid by the blocker corporation, thus ensuring that the general partner is not “penalized” by the tax situation of the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign taxable investors.

Yet, this structure may be sensible if the _fund_ intends to borrow money in order to finance its portfolio investments, thereby putting the U.S. tax-exempt investors at risk of incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from debt-financed investments. By interposing the blocker corporation between the fund and the U.S. tax-exempt investors, the U.S. tax-exempt investors will not incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> since the blocker corporation pays taxes on its share of the income that would otherwise be tainted with <abbr>UBTI</abbr> and distributes passive income to the tax-exempt investors. 

Second, let us look at how a blocker corporation interposed between the fund and the portfolio company would look:

<figure class="border l" id="fig03b">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03b-s.png 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03b-m.png 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03b-s-@2x.png 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03b-l.png 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03b-m-@2x.png 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03b-l-@2x.png 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03b-s.png" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 3b:</span> Interposing a blocker corporation between the flow-through portfolio company and the fund</figcaption>
</figure>

The chief advantage of this structure is flexibility. Not all investments that a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund makes will generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>. By situating the blocker corporation between the flow-through portfolio company and the fund, the fund sponsor has the flexibility to use the blocker corporation _solely_ for transactions that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>. For transactions that do not generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>, the fund will route the capital contributed by U.S. tax-exempt investors (and foreign taxable investors) directly into the corporate portfolio company, thereby eliminating the additional cost, complexity, and tax burden of the blocker corporation.

By using a single blocker corporation to hold all investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>, the fund sponsor can offset income and gains from one portfolio investment with losses from another portfolio investment. This can be particularly useful to reduce the taxable income of the blocker corporation, and thus reduce the taxes payable by the blocker.

The disadvantage to the general partner of this structure is that the general partner’s carried interest is computed at the level of the fund, and thus the use of a blocker corporation between the fund and the <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr> generating portfolio investments has the effect of reducing the carried interest payable to the general partner by the amount of taxes paid by the blocker corporation. A fund sponsor can, however, structure around this by interposing a flow-through entity between the blocker corporation and the portfolio investments, with the carried interest being charged at this level, i.e. before taxes paid by the blocker corporation.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fref14">14</a></sup> 

Third, let us look at how a blocker corporation serving as a parallel fund or <abbr>AIV</abbr> to the main fund would look:

<figure class="border l" id="fig03c">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03c-s.png 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03c-m.png 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03c-s-@2x.png 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03c-l.png 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03c-m-@2x.png 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03c-l-@2x.png 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig03c-s.png" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 3c:</span> A blocker corporation serving as a parallel fund or <abbr>AIV</abbr> to the main fund</figcaption>
</figure>

Rather than situating the blocker corporation between the U.S. tax-exempt investors and the fund ([Figure 3A](#fig03a)) or between the fund and the portfolio investments ([Figure 3B](#fig03b)), in this structure the fund sponsor incorporates an <abbr>AIV</abbr> (usually but not always in a foreign low or zero tax jurisdiction) for each investment that generates <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>. For investments that do not generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>, all the limited partners invest through the fund. 

The main advantage of this structure is flexibility. It allows the fund to set up <abbr>AIV</abbr>s only when necessary, and segregates portfolio investments from each other. It is also likely to be more beneficial for foreign taxable investors, as will be seen below.

### Income from debt-financed investments

A U.S. tax-exempt investor in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund can also incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> if the investment that produces income or gain is acquired with money borrowed by the U.S. tax-exempt investor or the fund. As the U.S. tax-exempt investor is very unlikely to use leverage to acquire its interest in the fund since it is well aware of the <abbr>UBIT</abbr> risk, the main risk is likely to be that the fund will borrow money to finance acquisitions.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fref15">15</a></sup> This can occur where the fund has a short-term revolving credit facility, often referred to as a “subscription credit facility”, to allow it to fund portfolio investments pending receipt of moneys from capital calls. 

#### The solution

There are two main structures that can be used to resolve the problem of <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from debt-financed investments where it is the fund that is borrowing money to finance its portfolio investments. 

First, one can rely on a blocker corporation, either in a structure such as the one shown in [Figure 3A](#fig03a) or in [Figure 4](#fig04). This works best where the fund has made long-term borrowings to finance portfolio investments, and where a significant fraction of its investments are likely to incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr>. 

<figure class="border l" id="fig04">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig04-s.png 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig04-m.png 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig04-s-@2x.png 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig04-l.png 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig04-m-@2x.png 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig04-l-@2x.png 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/20150622-fig04-s.png" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 4:</span> A blocker corporation owned by the fund that serves as the borrower</figcaption>
</figure>

In the structure shown in [Figure 4](#fig04), the fund incorporates a subsidiary to serve as the borrower for the subscription credit facility. This subsidiary is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and its obligations to the lenders is secured by guarantees or pledges from the fund.

Second, one can rely on the fact that capital gains from a debt-financed investment will not be treated as incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr> if the following conditions are met: 

* The indebtedness that would have given rise to <abbr>UBTI</abbr> was repaid more than one year prior to the disposal of the debt-financed investment 
* The debt-financed investment made no distributions of income (e.g. dividends, interest, rents, royalties) during the relevant fiscal year<sup><a href="#fn16" id="#fref16">16</a></sup> 
 
To the extent that the fund is making use of a subscription credit facility for short-term borrowings to “bridge” a gap between the time a transaction closes and the time the fund receives capital called from its limited partners<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fref17">17</a></sup>, it will often be able to rely on the second option to avoid incurring debt-financed <abbr>UBIT</abbr>, since most portfolio investments held by a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund will be held for approximately three to five years, and the borrowings under the subscription agreement will typically be repaid relatively quickly once capital is called from the fund’s limited partners.

### Transaction fees and advisory fees

Many <abbr>PE</abbr> fund sponsors charge various transaction, advisory, or monitoring fees to their portfolio companies.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fref18">18</a></sup> Such fees are paid from the assets of the portfolio companies and thereby reduce the returns to limited partners. As a general rule, limited partners will try to compel the fund sponsor to share all or part of these fees with them. 

However, U.S. tax-exempt investors will be concerned that if the fund receives a share of these fees, it may be deemed to be [income from a business or trade](#incomefromatradeorbusiness), and thus <abbr>UBTI</abbr> if the fund is a flow-through entity (e.g. a limited partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr>) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

#### The solution

To minimize this risk, almost all <abbr>PE</abbr> funds will arrange for the these transaction, advisory, or monitoring fees to be paid to the general partner of the fund.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fref19">19</a></sup> The general partner will then apply some or all of the fees it receives towards reducing the _next period’s_ management fee paid to the general partners by the limited partners. If there is any excess of fees received over the management fee payable by the limited partners, this excess will typically be carried forward to be applied against future management fees payable by the limited partners, and will _not_ be paid out to the limited partners. 

While this solution has never been fully tested in litigation, and might still run afoul of the assignment of income doctrine,<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fref20">20</a></sup> there seems to be relatively little sign—as of June 2015—that this solution is likely to be challenged by the <abbr>IRS</abbr>. I would be fairly confident in predicting that this solution, which has been extensively used in the <abbr>PE</abbr> industry, will continue to be used by most fund sponsors and limited partners. 

## U.S. taxable investors

U.S. taxable investors (typically <abbr title="High Net Worth Individuals">HNWI</abbr>s and corporate investors such as insurance companies) will typically invest directly in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund structured as a flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, e.g. a limited partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr>. For these investors, the flow-through nature of a limited partnership fulfills the following objectives: 

* The fund does not bear taxes and thus there is no double taxation on distributions from portfolio investments; instead, each U.S. taxable investor bears taxes on its allocation of ordinary income and capital gains from the fund
* The nature of the income and capital gains from the portfolio investments is unchanged in the hands of the U.S. taxable investors, and thus such investors can claim long-term capital gains on investments held for more than one year

Tax structuring for U.S. taxable investors is thus fairly simple, at least in the case of a fund investing in U.S. portfolio companies. They should invest directly in a fund organized as a flow-through entity, as per [Figure 1](#fig01). 

That being said, fund sponsors that invest in portfolio companies outside the U.S. do need to engage in tax structuring for U.S. taxable investors, due to the existence of extremely convoluted tax rules relating to controlled foreign corporations and passive foreign investment companies held by U.S. taxable investors.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fref21">21</a></sup>

### Controlled Foreign Corporations

The objective of the controlled foreign corporation regime, enacted in 1962, was to reduce the ability of U.S. taxable investors to defer paying U.S. federal income taxes on income earned by foreign corporations owned by these U.S. taxable investors. 

To do so, the <abbr title="Controlled Foreign Corporation">CFC</abbr> regime defines a <abbr>CFC</abbr> as a foreign corporation where, on _any day_ during the fiscal year for that corporation, more than 50% of the total value of the foreign corporation’s stock or more than 50% of the combined voting power of all classes of the foreign corporation’s voting stock is owned by U.S. shareholders, which is <span id="usshareholder">defined as a U.S. person<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fref22">22</a></sup> that owns more than 10% of the total value of the foreign corporation’s stock or voting power</span>. The rationale behind the definition of U.S. shareholders as U.S. persons owning more than 10% of the total value or voting power was to ensure that only foreign corporations where a group of U.S. persons had some ability to influence the decisions of the foreign corporation were included in the <abbr>CFC</abbr> regime. 

There are a number of attribution rules and constructive ownership rules that allow the <abbr>IRS</abbr> to aggregate shareholdings of certain related individuals to determine whether a U.S. person should be deemed to own more than 10% of the total value of the foreign corporation’s stock or voting power. Notably, a U.S. citizen or resident’s shareholding will be aggregated with the shareholdings of his or her parents, spouse, children (including by adoption), or grandchildren, because it is presumed that these people will share a common interest and purpose in deferring taxes. For that matter, under the constructive ownership rules,<sup><a href="#fn23" id="fref23">23</a></sup> a U.S. person that indirectly owns stock in a foreign corporation through another holding company (in which that U.S. person is a majority shareholder), partnership, estate or trust, will be deemed to own a proportionate share (based on his or her stockholding of the holding company or beneficial interest in the partnership, estate or trust) of the foreign corporation for the purpose of calculating whether that U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder for <abbr>CFC</abbr> purposes. In the interest of brevity, and because yours truly is not an expert tax counsel, I will refrain from going into the details of the attribution and constructive ownership rules, since there are minefields for the unwary. 

If a foreign corporation is a <abbr>CFC</abbr> for an uninterrupted period of 30 days during the taxable year,<sup><a href="#fn24" id="fref24">24</a></sup> the U.S. taxable investors will owe U.S. federal income taxes on certain forms of income earned by a <abbr>CFC</abbr>, known as “Subpart F” income, and regardless of whether the <abbr>CFC</abbr> has made any distributions of such income. While going into the details of Subpart F is beyond the scope of this survey, I will make a few general observations. 

First, U.S. taxable investors in a <abbr>CFC</abbr> are not required to include in their current year taxable income any income of the <abbr>CFC</abbr> derived from the conduct of a trade or business entirely outside of the U.S. Taxation of this income is deferred until it is repatriated to the U.S. by way of dividends paid to the U.S. taxable investors.

Second, U.S. taxable investors must include in their current year taxable income any income of the <abbr>CFC</abbr> foreign personal holding company income. The <abbr>IRC</abbr> defines this as income derived from passive investments held by the <abbr>CFC</abbr>, such as dividends, interest, rents, royalties and capital gains on investments in commodities, foreign currencies, derivatives, equity or debt instruments. 

Third, gains from the sale of equity in a <abbr>CFC</abbr> will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains in the hands of a U.S. shareholder (as [previously defined](#usshareholder)) to the extent of the <abbr>CFC</abbr>’s accumulated earnings (less any applicable foreign tax credits) during the period that the U.S. shareholder held the equity and the foreign corporation was a <abbr>CFC</abbr>.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="fref25">25</a></sup> 

For these reasons, a U.S. taxable investor will be very interested in ensuring that the fund sponsor has taken positive steps to minimize the impact of the <abbr>CFC</abbr> regime. 

#### The solution

For fund sponsors that accept investments from U.S. taxable investors, one way of dealing with the <abbr>CFC</abbr> is to structure the fund and the general partner in a foreign jurisdiction.

    <figcaption><span>Figure 5:</span> Structuring the fund and fund manager offshore</figcaption>
</figure>

This structure works on the premise that a fund incorporated as a U.S. partnership is treated as a single U.S. person for the purpose of determining whether any U.S. person meets the definition of a “U.S. shareholder” and for the purpose of determining whether a foreign corporation is a <abbr>CFC</abbr>. 

So, to take an example, a U.S. <abbr>PE</abbr> fund that has ten investors—consisting of seven foreign investors and three U.S. taxable investors—acquires 90% of the shares a company incorporated in Singapore (the remaining 10% of the shares of the company are owned by Singaporean citizens). The Singapore company is a <abbr>CFC</abbr> because the U.S. <abbr>PE</abbr> fund owns 90% of its shares, and thus 90% of its shares are owned by a single U.S. shareholder. This is the case notwithstanding the fact that only 27% of the shares of the Singapore company (30% of 90%) is in fact owned by U.S. investors in the <abbr>PE</abbr> fund.

A fund incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction such as the Cayman Islands, however, is not. Instead, each U.S. taxable investor in the partnership is treated separately for the purpose of determining whether more than 50% of the shares of the foreign company are owned by U.S. taxable investors. 

So, returning to the Singapore company example above, assume that the number of foreign and U.S. taxable investors in the <abbr>PE</abbr> fund is the same (seven foreign investors and three U.S. taxable investors), but the fund is organized in the Cayman Islands. Assume also that the <abbr>PE</abbr> fund acquires the same 90% of the shares in the Singapore company, and the remaining 10% are owned by Singaporean citizens. Here, the Singapore company is _not_ a <abbr>CFC</abbr>. First, the fund is _not_ treated as a single U.S. person. Second, each U.S. taxable investor in the fund is treated as a separate U.S. person, and each holds 9% of the shares in the Singapore company, below the threshold to be deemed a U.S. shareholder for the purpose of the <abbr>CFC</abbr> regime. Even if the ownership of one of the U.S. taxable investors was attributed to another using the attribution rules or constructive ownership rules, that would mean there was only one U.S. taxable investor that was classified as a U.S. shareholder (holding 18% of the shares). Third, less than 50% of the shares of the Singapore company are owned by U.S. shareholders (following from the fact that either no individual U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder under the <abbr>CFC</abbr> regime or at most one U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder holding 18% of the shares of the Singapore company). 

### Passive Foreign Investment Companies

Not content with dealing with the risk of tax deferral through foreign corporations controlled by U.S. taxable investors meeting certain defined shareholding criteria, Congress passed a set of rules to deal U.S. investments in foreign investment companies, the <abbr title="Passive Foreign Investment Company">PFIC</abbr> regime. 

A <abbr>PFIC</abbr> is defined as a foreign corporation where either 75% or more of its gross income for the year is passive income or 50% or more of its assets produce passive income or are held for the purpose of producing passive income.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="fref26">26</a></sup> Note that unlike the <abbr>CFC</abbr> regime, the <abbr>PFIC</abbr> regime has no threshold below which a U.S. taxable investor is not deemed to be invested in a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>. Even owning one share in a company that meets the definition of a <abbr>PFIC</abbr> exposes a U.S. taxable investor to the <abbr>PFIC</abbr> regime. Unlike a <abbr>CFC</abbr>, once a foreign corporation is classified as a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, it is _always_ a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, even if it no longer meets the definition in subsequent years. 

There is an exception to the <abbr>PFIC</abbr> regime for startups, which often have only passive income (most likely interest on a working capital bank account) in their early years. A startup is not treated as a <abbr>PFIC</abbr> during the first year it has gross income if it meets certain conditions: 

* No predecessor corporation of the startup was a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>
* The startup can establish to the satisfaction of the <abbr>IRS</abbr> that it will not be a <abbr>PFIC</abbr> in either of the two years following the startup year  
* The startup is _in fact_ not a <abbr>PFIC</abbr> in either of the two years following the startup year

When a U.S. taxable investor invested in a <abbr>PFIC</abbr> and receives distributions or sells its interest in the <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, it is subject to the following tax treatment:

    <table id="table01">

            <td>Taxed as ordinary income deemed to have been distributed ratably over the U.S. taxable investor’s holding period and taxed at the highest applicable marginal income tax rate for each relevant year, and with interest charged at the relevant federal underpayment rate for each year</td>

        <tr>

            <td>Excess distribution (any amount greater than 125% of the average distributions made to the U.S. taxable investor within the lesser of the last 3 years or the actual holding period of that investor)</td>
            <td>
                <p><strong>Amount allocated to the current year:</strong> Taxed as ordinary income at the current year’s marginal income tax rate</p>
                <p><strong>Amounts allocated to previous years:</strong> Taxed as ordinary income deemed to have been distributed ratably over the U.S. taxable investor’s holding period and taxed at the highest applicable marginal income tax rate for each relevant year, and with interest charged at the relevant federal underpayment rate for each year</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Non-excess distribution</td>
            <td>Taxed as ordinary income at the current year’s marginal income tax rate</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

Where a foreign corporation falls within the definition of both the <abbr>CFC</abbr> and <abbr>PFIC</abbr> regimes, the <abbr>CFC</abbr> regime will apply.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="fref27">27</a></sup>

As we can see, the overall impact of the <abbr>PFIC</abbr> regime is to convert what might otherwise have been capital gains from disposing of an interest in a <abbr>PFIC</abbr> into ordinary income taxed at the highest marginal income tax rate _and_ with an interest penalty, and tax “excess” distributions at the same punitive rate. Not exactly something guaranteed to endear the <abbr>IRS</abbr> to U.S. taxable investors. 

A wise fund sponsor tries not to invest in companies that are <abbr>PFIC</abbr>s. As a general rule, I would be quite surprised if the average <abbr>PE</abbr>investment turns out to be a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, given that the vast majority of such companies are active operating companies. <abbr>VC</abbr> funds investing abroad _may_ end up investing in startups that, at least for the first few years of their operations, are <abbr>PFIC</abbr>s, and thanks to the rule “once a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, always a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>”, may end up having to find a solution for their U.S. taxable investors. 

#### The solution

So, what can a sensible U.S. taxable investor, who wants avoid paying the exorbitant tax rates on <abbr>PFIC</abbr>s, do? 

He makes a <abbr title="Qualified Electing Fund">QEF</abbr> election, obviously. No, not really _obviously,_ unless you’re one of those unusual persons who devote years of their life to understanding the U.S. tax code. This election must be made in the _first year_ that the U.S. taxable investor is deemed to be invested in a <abbr>PFIC</abbr>. If this is not done, the U.S. taxable investor may have to apply for a private letter ruling from the <abbr>IRS</abbr> to allow it to make a retrospective <abbr>QEF</abbr> election. 

Once a <abbr>QEF</abbr> election is made, the U.S. taxable investor must report in each fiscal year its pro rata share of the ordinary income and capital gains of the <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, and pay taxes on that amount regardless of whether the <abbr>PFIC</abbr> has made any distributions to the U.S. taxable investor. The benefit of this election, though, is that when the <abbr>PFIC</abbr> does make a distribution, such distribution is not subject to tax to the extent that it relates to amounts that the U.S. taxable investor has already paid taxes on.

To make this election, though, the fund sponsor must ensure that any <abbr>PFIC</abbr>s that it invests in provides specified information on a “<abbr>PFIC</abbr> Annual Information Statement” to allow the U.S. taxable investors to calculate its share of the corporation’s ordinary earnings and net capital gains for the fiscal year. 

## Foreign tax-exempt investors



#### The solution

For the most part, tax structuring for foreign tax-exempt investors is relatively similar to the tax structuring necessary for U.S. tax-exempt investors. 

## Foreign taxable investors

Foreign taxable investors are another major investor in <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds. As a general rule, foreign taxable investors are subject to 

### Effectively Connected Income



#### The solution

For the foreign taxable investors, there is one further disadvantage to holding all <abbr>ECI</abbr> generating investments in a single blocker corporation. Assuming that the investments are disposed of at different times, the blocker corporation will have to distribute the proceeds of that disposal by paying a dividend rather than a liquidating distribution.
