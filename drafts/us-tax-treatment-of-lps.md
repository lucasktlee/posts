<p class="lede">Fund structuring is often complicated by the myriad rules and regulations promulgated by the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> and other tax authorities. It can, for the uninitiated fund sponsor, be a proliferation of unfamiliar acronyms and arcane section references: <abbr>CAI</abbr> <abbr>CFC</abbr>, <abbr>ECI</abbr>, <abbr>FIRPTA</abbr>, <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, <abbr>QEF</abbr>, Section 892, <abbr>UBIT</abbr>, <abbr>UBTI</abbr>&#8230; What do these acronyms and section references mean?</p>

More pertinent, why should a fund sponsor care?

The short answer, is “because prospective limited partners care”. A fund’s tax structuring is often the subject of fairly extensive due diligence and negotiation by prospective limited partners, and in extreme situations where the fund sponsor cannot accommodate a prospective investor’s tax structuring requirements can result in that investor declining to make an investment. It can also affect both the fund sponsor’s choice of jurisdiction to organize the fund as well as the structure of the fund. As such, it behoves a shrewd fund sponsor to take the time to understand the effects of the different tax treatment accorded to certain categories of prospective limited partners, and some of the common solutions used by fund sponsors and their counsel.

Before we embark on this somewhat torturous journey through the complications of the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Code">IRC</abbr>, I must first address a few preliminary matters, lest this journey become lost as Odysseus was, after Troy. 

The first thing to do is to narrow our focus. I will discuss only the U.S. federal income tax treatment of U.S. and non-U.S. investors in a <abbr title="private equity">PE</abbr>/<abbr title="venture capital">VC</abbr> fund that invests in portfolio companies in the U.S. and outside the U.S. I will not discuss the effects of <abbr title="Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act">FATCA</abbr> on fund structuring. I will also not discuss any other country’s tax regime on investment funds and their investors. 

Second, we must understand how the different rules promulgated by the <abbr>IRS</abbr> has divided limited partners into four broad categories: 

* **U.S. tax-exempt investors:** The <abbr>IRS</abbr> prescribes a fairly long list of entities that qualify as a tax-exempt organization, which I will not enumerate in toto here. These include corporations organized under an Act of Congress and that have been explicitly exempted from federal income taxes,<sup><a href="fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary organizations,<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> chambers of commerce,<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> social and recreational clubs,<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup> political organizations,<sup><a href="fref05" id="fref05">5</a></sup> farmers’ cooperatives,<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fref06">6</a></sup> private foundations,<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fref07">7</a></sup>, federal, state, and local governmental plans,<sup><a href="#fn08" id="fref08">8</a></sup> and employee benefit plans.<sup><a href="#fn09" id="fref09">9</a></sup>
* **U.S. taxable investors:** Broadly speaking, taxable investors in the United States should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any U.S. investor that cannot be categorized as a U.S. tax-exempt organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 
* **Foreign tax-exempt investors:** Per the well-established principle of sovereign immunity, foreign governments, their political subdivisions, and their controlled entities are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Foreign tax-exempt organizations are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Certain international organizations designated by executive orders are exempt from taxes on all U.S. source income.
* **Foreign taxable investors:** Like their American counterparts, foreign taxable investors should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any foreign investor that cannot be categorized as a foreign government, tax-exempt organization, or designated international organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 

Each of these categories of investors have separate tax concerns that a fund sponsor must address through fund structuring or investment structuring. 

Third, we should understand how a fund is typically structured, in the absence of any compelling tax structuring, in order to better understand how tax structuring for all these investors affects the basic structure. 

A typical, plain-vanilla <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund will be structured as a limited partnership (as shown in [Figure 1](#fig01)):

    <figcaption><span>Figure 1:</span> Typical <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund structure</figcaption>
</figure>

I have previously mentioned the reasons why the limited partnership is the [preferred fund structure](http://lucasktlee.com/2014/08/28/introduction-to-private-equity-fund-terms/) for most <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds, and shall not repeat myself here. It suffices to note that most funds organized in Anglo-American common law jurisdictions will use a limited partnership as their default approach.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fref10">10</a></sup> 

## U.S. tax-exempt investors

U.S. tax-exempt investors are one of the largest investors in <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds. As their name implies, these investors are—as a general rule—not taxed on their share of a fund’s capital gains or ordinary income. The general rule is, however, subject to one significant exception: the U.S. federal government taxes the gross income of U.S. tax-exempt investors derived from commercial activities unrelated to their tax-exempt purpose, better known by its abbreviation, <abbr title="unrelated business taxable income">UBTI</abbr>. The U.S. tax-exempt investor must file a U.S. federal income tax return and pay U.S. federal income taxes (<abbr title="Unrelated Business Income Tax">UBIT</abbr>) on investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> regardless of whether the investor has received any distributions from those investments.

A U.S tax-exempt investor that invests in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund can incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr> in one of three ways: 

1. Income from a trade or business
2. Income from debt-financed investments 
3. Transaction fees and advisory fees earned by the <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund from its operations

Before we go into the details of how fund sponsors can structure their fund to minimize the risk that U.S. tax-exempt investors incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr>, it is always instructive to understand _why_ Congress, in its—_ahem_—infinite wisdom, decided that it was necessary to enact legislation imposing this tax on U.S. tax-exempt investors. 

### A brief history of <abbr>UBTI</abbr>

Taxation of <abbr>UBTI</abbr> had its origins in the entry of non-profit organizations into commercial ventures. In 1924, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that because all of the income from commercial and investment activities conducted by a U.S. tax-exempt organization was used to support the organization’s tax-exempt purpose, such income was not subject to tax. Following this decision, numerous tax-exempt organizations began incorporating “feeder” corporations to operate commercial businesses—including hotels, cattle ranches, fruit orchards, textile mills, departmental stores, and real estate leasing businesses—that were unrelated to these organizations’ tax-exempt purposes. These feeder corporations distributed all of their profits to the tax-exempt owners to use for their tax-exempt purposes. The income from these feeder corporations was exempt from U.S. federal income tax. 

Commercial ventures owned by U.S. taxable investors, it must be said, were not sanguine about competition from commercial ventures owned by tax-exempt investors; they feared that competitors operated by tax-exempt organizations might undercut their prices or reinvest tax-free profits to expand more rapidly and thereby drive the taxable commercial ventures out of business. Congress and the Internal Revenue Bureau (the predecessor to the <abbr>IRS</abbr>) were concerned about both this unfair competition and the risk that the growth of such tax-exempt commercial ventures would inevitably shrink the tax base.

As a result of this concern, in 1954 Congress imposed a tax on <abbr>UBTI</abbr> generated by the commercial activities of U.S. tax-exempt organizations. 

### Income from a trade or business

<abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds are typically considered as “investment partnerships”<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fref11">11</a></sup> for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and are thus deemed not to be engaged in a trade or business. Thus, an investment in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund will not in itself result a U.S. tax-exempt investor incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr>. This is not to say, however, that a U.S. tax-exempt investor can never incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from its investment in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund. 

The most obvious way in which a U.S. tax-exempt investor in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund can incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr> is when the fund invests in a portfolio company that has been incorporated or organized as a flow-through entity (a partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr>) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The income earned by such a portfolio company is characterized as income from an active business, and retains that characterization in the hands of the <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund. If the fund is itself a flow-through entity—most funds are—then the limited partners of the fund will each receive a proportionate share of this income, which continues to retain its characterization as income from an active business. In the hands of a U.S. tax-exempt investor, this active income would result in the U.S. tax-exempt investor incurring <abbr>UBTI</abbr>.

<figure class="l" id="fig02">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 2:</span> Incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from an active business organized as a partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr></figcaption>
</figure>

This situation is more likely to occur when a U.S. tax-exempt investor invests in a <abbr>VC</abbr> fund: some startups are formed as <abbr>LLC</abbr>s rather than as corporations to avoid corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. That being said, it is still rare to see a <abbr>VC</abbr> fund invest in a flow-through entity; most <abbr>VC</abbr>s will require the startups they invest in to either be incorporated as a corporation<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fref12">12</a></sup> (i.e. not a flow-through entity) or convert from an <abbr>LLC</abbr> to a corporation prior to their investment. By contrast, <abbr>PE</abbr> funds seldom invest in portfolio companies that are treated as flow-through entities: most mature companies were either incorporated as a corporation from the start, or converted to a corporation at some point in the past. 

#### The solution

Most fund sponsors have traditionally structure their fund to minimize <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from a trade or business by using some form of “blocker corporation”. The blocker corporation is not a flow-through entity; rather, it is taxed as a corporation and reports and pays U.S. federal income tax on its share of the active income from the flow-through portfolio company. When this blocker corporation distributes the income it receives to its shareholders, the income is characterized as dividend income, which does not incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> unless the shares in the blocker corporation are [debt-financed](#incomefromdebtfinancedinvestments).

There are three main structures that can be used to minimize <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from flow-through entities:

* A blocker corporation between the fund and the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign taxable investors<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fref13">13</a></sup> ([Figure 3A](#fig03a))
* A blocker corporation between the flow-through portfolio company and the fund ([Figure 3B](#fig03b))
* A blocker corporation serving as either a parallel fund to the main fund or an <abbr title="Alternative Investment Vehicle">AIV</abbr> ([Figure 3C](#fig03c))

The choice of which structure to use will often involve judgment as to the likelihood that the fund will invest in investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> (and <abbr title="Effectively Connected Income">ECI</abbr>), and the likelihood of the fund incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr>. Determining the appropriate structure is an exercise best done with skilled tax counsel, taking into account the investment strategy that the fund sponsor intends to pursue and the likelihood that the fund’s portfolio investments will incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr>.

First, let us look at how a blocker corporation interposed between the investors and the fund would look: 

<figure class="l" id="fig03a">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 3a:</span> Interposing a blocker corporation between the fund and the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign investors</figcaption>
</figure>

Interposing a blocker corporation (typically incorporated in a foreign, low or zero tax jurisdiction) between the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign taxable investors) and the fund will prevent the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign investors from incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr> and <abbr>ECI</abbr> from the fund’s investments in flow-through portfolio companies and debt-financed investments, respectively. These investors will not be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return solely because of their investment in the fund, since the blocker corporation will be the recipient of the income that would otherwise be <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>. 

In this structure, _all_ investments made by the fund—not just investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> or <abbr>ECI</abbr>—will be held through the blocker corporation. Given that the blocker corporation _is_ subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its U.S. sourced income, this structure is not the most tax efficient for the U.S. tax-exempt and foreign taxable investors.

Yet, this structure may be sensible if the _fund_ intends to borrow money in order to finance its portfolio investments, thereby putting the U.S. tax-exempt investors at risk of incurring <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from debt-financed investments. By interposing the blocker corporation between the fund and the U.S. tax-exempt investors, the U.S. tax-exempt investors will not incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> since the blocker corporation pays taxes on its share of the income that would otherwise be tainted with <abbr>UBTI</abbr> and distributes passive income to the tax-exempt investors. 

Second, let us look at how a blocker corporation interposed between the fund and the portfolio company would look:

<figure class="l" id="fig03b">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 3b:</span> Interposing a blocker corporation between the flow-through portfolio company and the fund</figcaption>
</figure>

Third, let us look at how a blocker corporation serving as a parallel fund to the main fund would look:

<figure class="l" id="fig03c">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 3c:</span> A blocker corporation serving as a parallel fund or <abbr>AIV</abbr> to the main fund</figcaption>
</figure>

### Income from debt-financed investments

A U.S. tax-exempt investor in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund can also incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr> if the investment that produces income or gain is acquired with money borrowed by the U.S. tax-exempt investor or the fund. As the U.S. tax-exempt investor is very unlikely to use leverage to acquire its interest in the fund since it is well aware of the <abbr>UBIT</abbr> risk, the main risk is likely to be that the fund will borrow money to finance acquisitions.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fref14">14</a></sup> This can occur where the fund has a short-term revolving credit facility, a subscription credit facility, to allow it to fund portfolio investments pending receipt of moneys from capital calls. 

#### The solution

There are two main structures that can be used to resolve the problem of <abbr>UBIT</abbr> from debt-financed investments where it is the fund that is borrowing money to finance its portfolio investments. 

First, one can rely on a blocker corporation, either in a structure such as the one shown in [Figure 3A](#fig03a) or in [Figure 3D](#fig03d). This works best where the fund has made long-term borrowings to finance portfolio investments, and where a significant fraction of its investments are likely to incur <abbr>UBIT</abbr>. 

<figure class="l" id="fig03d">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/" />
    <figcaption><span>Figure 3d:</span> A blocker corporation owned by the fund that serves as the borrower</figcaption>
</figure>

In the structure shown in [Figure 3D](#fig03d), 

Second, one can rely on the fact that gains from a debt-financed investment will be 

### Transaction fees and advisory fees

Many <abbr>PE</abbr> fund sponsors charge various transaction, advisory, or monitoring fees to their portfolio companies.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fref15">15</a></sup> Such fees are paid from the assets of the portfolio companies and thereby reduce the returns to limited partners. As a general rule, limited partners will try to compel the fund sponsor to share all or part of these fees with them. 

However, U.S. tax-exempt investors will be concerned that if the fund receives a share of these fees, it may be deemed to be [income from a business or trade](#incomefromatradeorbusiness), and thus <abbr>UBTI</abbr> if the fund is a flow-through entity (e.g. a limited partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr>) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

#### The solution

To minimize this risk, almost all <abbr>PE</abbr> funds will arrange for the these transaction, advisory, or monitoring fees to be paid to the general partner of the fund.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fref16">16</sup> The general partner will then apply some or all of the fees it receives towards reducing the _next period’s_ management fee paid to the general partners by the limited partners. If there is any excess of fees received over the management fee payable by the limited partners, this excess will typically be carried forward to be applied against future management fees payable by the limited partners, and will _not_ be paid out to the limited partners. 

While this solution has never been fully tested in litigation, and might still run afoul of the assignment of income doctrine,<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fref17">17</a></sup> there seems to be relatively little sign—as of June 2015—that this solution is likely to be challenged by the <abbr>IRS</abbr>. I would be fairly confident in predicting that this solution, which has been extensively used in the <abbr>PE</abbr> industry, will continue to be used by most fund sponsors and limited partners. 

## U.S. taxable investors



#### The solution



## Foreign tax-exempt investors



## Foreign taxable investors

In general the U.S. is quite a favorable destination for foreign investors. Foreign investors are not taxed on their share of the capital gains from the sale of U.S. securities, including portfolio investments of a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund.
