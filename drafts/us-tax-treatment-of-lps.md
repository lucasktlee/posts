<p class="lede">Fund structuring is often complicated by the myriad rules and regulations promulgated by the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> and other tax authorities. It can, for the uninitiated fund sponsor, be a proliferation of unfamiliar acronyms and arcane section references: <abbr>CAI</abbr> <abbr>CFC</abbr>, <abbr>ECI</abbr>, <abbr>FIRPTA</abbr>, <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, <abbr>QEF</abbr>, Section 892, <abbr>UBTI</abbr>&#8230; What do these acronyms and section references mean?</p>

More pertinent, why should a fund sponsor care?

The short answer, is “because prospective limited partners care”. A fund’s tax structuring is often the subject of fairly extensive due diligence and negotiation by prospective limited partners, and in extreme situations where the fund sponsor cannot accommodate a prospective investor’s tax structuring requirements can result in that investor declining to make an investment. It can also affect both the fund sponsor’s choice of jurisdiction to organize the fund as well as the structure of the fund. As such, it behoves a shrewd fund sponsor to take the time to understand the effects of the different tax treatment accorded to certain categories of prospective limited partners, and some of the common solutions used by fund sponsors and their counsel.

Before we embark on this somewhat torturous journey through the complications of the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Code">IRC</abbr>, I must first address a few preliminary matters, lest this journey become lost as Odysseus was, after Troy. 

The first thing to do is to narrow our focus. I will discuss only the U.S. federal income tax treatment of U.S. and non-U.S. investors in a <abbr title="private equity">PE</abbr>/<abbr title="venture capital">VC</abbr> fund that invests in portfolio companies in the U.S. and outside the U.S. I will not discuss the effects of <abbr title="Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act">FATCA</abbr> on fund structuring. I will also not discuss any other country’s tax regime on investment funds and their investors. 

Second, we must understand how the different rules promulgated by the <abbr>IRS</abbr> has divided limited partners into four broad categories: 

* **U.S. tax-exempt investors:** The <abbr>IRS</abbr> prescribes a fairly long list of entities that qualify as a tax-exempt organization, which I will not enumerate in toto here. These include corporations organized under an Act of Congress and that have been explicitly exempted from federal income taxes,<sup><a href="fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary organizations,<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> chambers of commerce,<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> social and recreational clubs,<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup> political organizations,<sup><a href="fref05" id="fref05">5</a></sup> farmers’ cooperatives,<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fref06">6</sup> private foundations,<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fref07">7</a></sup>, federal, state, and local governmental plans,<sup><a href="#fn08" id="fref08">8</sup> and employee benefit plans.<sup><a href="#fn09" id="fref09">9</a></sup>
* **U.S. taxable investors:** Broadly speaking, taxable investors in the United States should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any U.S. investor that cannot be categorized as a U.S. tax-exempt organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 
* **Foreign tax-exempt investors:** Per the well-established principle of sovereign immunity, foreign governments, their political subdivisions, and their controlled entities are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Foreign tax-exempt organizations are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Certain international organizations designated by executive orders are exempt from taxes on all U.S. source income.
* **Foreign taxable investors:** Like their American counterparts, foreign taxable investors should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any foreign investor that cannot be categorized as a foreign government, tax-exempt organization, or designated international organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 

Each of these categories of investors have separate tax concerns that a fund sponsor must address through fund structuring or investment structuring. 

Third, we should understand how a fund is typically structured, in the absence of any compelling tax structuring, in order to better understand how tax structuring for all these investors affects the basic structure. 

A typical, plain-vanilla <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund will be structured as a limited partnership (as shown in [Figure 1](#fig01)):

<figure class="l" id="fig01">
    <img alt="" size="34.4rem, (min-width: 37.5625rem and max-width: 56.2500rem) 51.2rem, (min-width: 56.3125rem) 70.4rem" srcset="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 344w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 512w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 688w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 704w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1024w, http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/ 1408w" src="http://media.lucasktlee.com/files/img/" />
</figure>

I have previously mentioned the reasons why the limited partnership is the [preferred fund structure](http://lucasktlee.com/2014/08/28/introduction-to-private-equity-fund-terms/) for most <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds, and shall not repeat myself here. It suffices to note that most funds organized in Anglo-American common law jurisdictions will use a limited partnership as their default approach.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fref10">10</sup> 

## U.S. tax-exempt investors

U.S. tax-exempt investors are one of the largest investors in <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds. As their name implies, these investors are—as a general rule—not taxed on their share of a fund’s capital gains or ordinary income. The general rule is, however, subject to one significant exception: the U.S. federal government taxes the gross income of U.S. tax-exempt investors derived from commercial activities unrelated to their tax-exempt purpose, better known by its abbreviation, <abbr title="unrelated business taxable income">UBTI</abbr>. The U.S. tax-exempt investor must report—and pay U.S. federal income taxes on—investments that generate <abbr>UBTI</abbr> regardless of whether the investor has received any distributions from those investments.

A U.S tax-exempt investor that invests in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund can incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr> in one of three ways: 

1. Income from a trade or business
2. Income from debt-financed investments  
3. Transaction fees and advisory fees earned by the <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund from its operations

Before we go into the details of how fund sponsors can structure their fund to minimize the risk that U.S. tax-exempt investors incur <abbr>UBTI</abbr>, it is always instructive to understand _why_ Congress, in its—_ahem_—infinite wisdom, decided that it was necessary to enact legislation imposing this tax on U.S. tax-exempt investors. 

### A brief history of <abbr>UBTI</abbr>

Taxation of <abbr>UBTI</abbr> had its origins in the entry of non-profit organizations into commercial ventures. In 1924, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that because all of the income from commercial and investment activities conducted by a U.S. tax-exempt organization was used to support the organization’s tax-exempt purpose, such income was not subject to tax. Following this decision, numerous tax-exempt organizations began incorporating “feeder” corporations to operate commercial businesses—including hotels, cattle ranches, fruit orchards, textile mills, departmental stores, and real estate leasing businesses—that were unrelated to these organizations’ tax-exempt purposes. These feeder corporations distributed all of their profits to the tax-exempt owners to use for their tax-exempt purposes. The income from these feeder corporations was exempt from U.S. federal income tax. 

Commercial ventures owned by U.S. taxable investors, it must be said, were not sanguine about competition from commercial ventures owned by tax-exempt investors; they feared that competitors operated by tax-exempt organizations might undercut their prices or reinvest tax-free profits to expand more rapidly and thereby drive the taxable commercial ventures out of business. Congress and the Internal Revenue Bureau (the predecessor to the <abbr>IRS</abbr>) were concerned about both this unfair competition and the risk that the growth of such tax-exempt commercial ventures would inevitably shrink the tax base.

As a result of this concern, in 1954 Congress imposed a tax on <abbr>UBTI</abbr> generated by the commercial activities of U.S. tax-exempt organizations.

### Transaction fees and advisory fees

Many <abbr>PE</abbr> fund sponsors charge various transaction, advisory, or monitoring fees to their portfolio companies.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fref11">11</a></sup> Such fees are paid from the assets of the portfolio companies and thereby reduce the returns to limited partners. As a general rule, limited partners will try to compel the fund sponsor to share all or part of these fees with them. 

However, U.S. tax-exempt investors will be concerned that if the fund receives a share of these fees, it may be deemed to be [income from a business or trade](#incomefromatradeorbusiness), and thus <abbr>UBTI</abbr> if the fund is a flow-through entity (e.g. a limited partnership or <abbr>LLC</abbr>) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

#### The solution

To avoid this risk, almost all <abbr>PE</abbr> funds will arrange for the these transaction, advisory, or monitoring fees to be paid to the general partner of the fund.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fref12">12</sup> The general partner will then apply some or all of the fees it receives towards reducing the _next period’s_ management fee paid to the general partners by the limited partners. If there is any excess of fees received over the management fee payable by the limited partners, this excess will typically be carried forward to be applied against future management fees payable by the limited partners, and will _not_ be paid out to the limited partners.
