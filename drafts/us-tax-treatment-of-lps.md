<p class="lede">Fund structuring is often complicated by the myriad rules and regulations promulgated by the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> and other tax authorities. It can, for the uninitiated fund sponsor, be a proliferation of unfamiliar acronyms and arcane section references: <abbr>CAI</abbr> <abbr>CFC</abbr>, <abbr>ECI</abbr>, <abbr>FIRPTA</abbr>, <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, <abbr>QEF</abbr>, Section 892, <abbr>UBTI</abbr>&#8230; What do these acronyms and section references mean?</p>

More pertinent, why should a fund sponsor care?

The short answer, is “because prospective limited partners care”. A fund’s tax structuring is often the subject of fairly extensive due diligence and negotiation by prospective limited partners, and in extreme situations where the fund sponsor cannot accommodate a prospective investor’s tax structuring requirements can result in that investor declining to make an investment. It can also affect both the fund sponsor’s choice of jurisdiction to organize the fund as well as the structure of the fund. As such, it behoves a shrewd fund sponsor to take the time to understand the effects of the different tax treatment accorded to certain categories of prospective limited partners, and some of the common solutions used by fund sponsors and their counsel.

The first thing to do is to narrow our focus. We will discuss only the U.S. federal income tax treatment of U.S. and non-U.S. investors in a <abbr title="private equity">PE</abbr>/<abbr title="venture capital">VC</abbr> fund that invests in portfolio companies in the U.S. and outside the U.S. We will not discuss the effects of <abbr title="Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act">FATCA</abbr> on fund structuring. We will also not discuss any other country’s tax regime on investment funds and their investors. 

The second thing to do is to define certain terms.

## U.S. tax-exempt investors

U.S. tax-exempt investors—state and municipal pension plans, university endowments, —are frequently one of the largest investors in <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> funds. 

## U.S. taxable investors



## Foreign taxable investors

In general, foreign taxable investors are exempt from capital gains taxes on portfolio investment activities.

Foreign taxable investors are most likely to face U.S. federal income tax issues where a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund invests in portfolio companies in the United States. There are two primary tax considerations that foreign taxable investors will want the fund to take into account: 

* Income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (<abbr title="effectively connected income">ECI</abbr>) 
* Gains from dispositions of interests in U.S. real estate (<abbr title="Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act">FIRPTA</abbr>)
