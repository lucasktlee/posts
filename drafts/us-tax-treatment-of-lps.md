<p class="lede">Fund structuring is often complicated by the myriad rules and regulations promulgated by the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> and other tax authorities. It can, for the uninitiated fund sponsor, be a proliferation of unfamiliar acronyms and arcane section references: <abbr>CAI</abbr> <abbr>CFC</abbr>, <abbr>ECI</abbr>, <abbr>FIRPTA</abbr>, <abbr>PFIC</abbr>, <abbr>QEF</abbr>, Section 892, <abbr>UBTI</abbr>&#8230; What do these acronyms and section references mean?</p>

More pertinent, why should a fund sponsor care?

The short answer, is “because prospective limited partners care”. A fund’s tax structuring is often the subject of fairly extensive due diligence and negotiation by prospective limited partners, and in extreme situations where the fund sponsor cannot accommodate a prospective investor’s tax structuring requirements can result in that investor declining to make an investment. It can also affect both the fund sponsor’s choice of jurisdiction to organize the fund as well as the structure of the fund. As such, it behoves a shrewd fund sponsor to take the time to understand the effects of the different tax treatment accorded to certain categories of prospective limited partners, and some of the common solutions used by fund sponsors and their counsel.

Before we embark on this somewhat torturous journey through the complications of the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Code">IRC</abbr>, I must first address a few preliminary matters, lest this journey become lost as Odysseus was, after Troy. 

The first thing to do is to narrow our focus. I will discuss only the U.S. federal income tax treatment of U.S. and non-U.S. investors in a <abbr title="private equity">PE</abbr>/<abbr title="venture capital">VC</abbr> fund that invests in portfolio companies in the U.S. and outside the U.S. I will not discuss the effects of <abbr title="Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act">FATCA</abbr> on fund structuring. I will also not discuss any other country’s tax regime on investment funds and their investors. 

Second, we must understand how the different rules promulgated by the <abbr>IRS</abbr> has divided limited partners into four broad categories: 

* **U.S. tax-exempt investors:** The <abbr>IRS</abbr> prescribes a fairly long list of entities that qualify as a tax-exempt organization, which I will not enumerate in toto here. These include corporations organized under an Act of Congress and that have been explicitly exempted from federal income taxes,<sup><a href="fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary organizations,<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> chambers of commerce,<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> social and recreational clubs,<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup> political organizations,<sup><a href="fref05" id="fref05">5</a></sup> farmers’ cooperatives,<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fref06">6</sup> private foundations,<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fref07">7</a></sup>, federal, state, and local governmental plans,<sup><a href="#fn08" id="fref08">8</sup> and employee benefit plans.<sup><a href="#fn09" id="fref09">9</a></sup>
* **U.S. taxable investors:** Broadly speaking, taxable investors in the United States should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any U.S. investor that cannot be categorized as a U.S. tax-exempt organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 
* **Foreign tax-exempt investors:** Per the well-established principle of sovereign immunity, foreign governments, their political subdivisions, and their controlled entities are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Foreign tax-exempt organizations are exempt from taxes on certain (but not all) forms of U.S. income (principally U.S. investment income). Certain international organizations designated by executive orders are exempt from taxes on all U.S. source income.
* **Foreign taxable investors:** Like their American counterparts, foreign taxable investors should be thought of as a “catch-all” category for any foreign investor that cannot be categorized as a U.S. tax-exempt organization. Investors falling into this category include high net worth individuals, corporations, family offices and private trusts. 

Each of these categories of investors have separate tax concerns that a fund sponsor must address in order to
