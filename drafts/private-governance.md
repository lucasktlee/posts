[Edward Peter Stringham](http://internet2.trincoll.edu/facProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1332120)’s recent book, [<cite>Private Governance</cite>](http://amzn.com/0199365164) came to my attention thanks to a blurb<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> from Peter Thiel. I have had a long-standing skepticism of the _necessity_ and _efficacy_ of government institutions.<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> It was therefore fascinating to read an _empirical_ exploration of the ways in which groups developed private rules and enforcement methods that allowed them to support complex transactions, the sort that many legal theorists and political economists claim could not happen without the existence of a strong state to generate and enforce laws. 

Before I say anything more, I would like to emphasize that this is is not a book review. I prefer to think of this as a set of thoughts and observations relating to the themes and examples in Stringham’s book.
