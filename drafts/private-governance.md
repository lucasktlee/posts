[Edward Peter Stringham](http://internet2.trincoll.edu/facProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1332120)’s recent book, [<cite>Private Governance</cite>](http://amzn.com/0199365164) came to my attention thanks to a blurb<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> from Peter Thiel. Having had a long-standing fascination with the _necessity_ of government institutions.



This is is not a book review. I prefer to think of this as a set of thoughts and observations relating to the themes and examples in Stringham’s book.
