<p class="lede">Having discussed purchase price adjustments, repressentations and warranties, indemnities, and closing conditions, I now turn to the last of the main sections of an acquisition agreement, the <em>covenants.</em></p>

Whenever an acquisition is signed on one date and closed on another date, there will be a need for covenants to protect the purchaser(s) from certain acts that the seller(s) could do during the period from signing to closing, and vice versa.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup>

## Definition

A proper understanding of the covenants in an acquisition agreement requires a definition of a “covenant”, as understood in Anglo-American law. At its most fundamental level, a covenant is a solemn promise to do, or to refrain from doing, something. A covenant can be a _positive covenant_ (a promise to _do_ something),<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> or a _negative covenant_ (a promise to _not do_ something).

An example of a positive covenant drawn from an acquisition agreement I worked on, providing that the target and the seller(s) would provide reasonable access to the premises and the records of the target and its subsidiaries:

> The Company shall, and the Sellers and the Company shall cause the Subsidaries
> to, give reasonable access to the Purchaser and its accountants, counsel,
> financial advisors and other representatives, and to prospective lenders,
> placement agents and other Debt Financing Sources and each of their respective
> representatives, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
> written notice, throughout the period prior to the Closing, to the Company’s
> and the Subsidiaries’ respective properties and facilities, Contracts and
> records of the Company and the Subsidiaries as such Person may reasonably
> request.

An example of a negative covenant drawn from an acquisition agreement I worked on, providing that the target and the seller(s) will not enter into a transaction to sell the target to any third party:

> The Company and the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of their
> respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates or representatives
> (including, without limitation, any of their respective investment bankers,
> attorneys, accountants, or other advisors) to, directly or indirectly, (i)
> solicit, initiate, support or encourage or take any other action to
> facilitate, any inquiries with respect to a potential or actual Alternative
> Transaction or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is
> reasonably likely to lead to, any Alternative Transaction; (ii) enter into,
> maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person or entity in
> furtherance of such inquiries or any Alternative Transaction; (iii) agree
> or allow the Company to agree or endorse or support any Alternative
> Transaction; or (iv) cause or allow the Company or any of its officers,
> directors, employees, affiliates or representatives to do any of the
> foregoing.

As an aside, covenants are practically ubiquitous in most financial contracts, particularly in leveraged loan agreements and bond indentures, which have extensive covenants that are designed to act as a “straitjacket” that reduces the risk that the borrower will take actions detrimental to the interest of the lenders. During 2009, immediately after the global financial crisis of 2008, I spent far too much time becoming fairly intimately aware of the details of these leveraged loan covenants, as Partners Group had private equity funds and mezzanine and senior debt funds.

## Common Covenants

Covenants in a private equity acquisition agreement range from almost boilerplate covenants inserted by attorneys as a matter of course, to bespoke covenants tailored for the transaction. I would note, however, that even boilerplate covenants can be negotiated, and the results of those negotiations can have real impact on the positions of the purchaser(s) and seller(s). I would never leave this entirely to counsel to address; there are too many things that could go wrong.

### Access to Information

The seller(s), the target company, and its subsidiaries will covenant to provide the purchaser(s) with access to the offices and premises of the target company and its subsidiaries, as well as access to the books and records of the target company and its subsidiaries.

While this is a boilerplate covenant, the details of what is covered by the covenant to provide access to information will be negotiated in some detail. The purchaser(s) will want to ensure that it has all the necessary access to the offices and premises of the target company and its subsidiaries to conduct due diligence of the physical property, plant and equipment of the target and its subsidiaries. Moreover, the purchaser(s) will also want access to the books and records of the target company and its subsidiaries to conduct due diligence on the business they are acquiring. The purchaser(s) will not want to be overly restricted in their ability to
