<p class="lede">I recently read a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/28/dear-vcs-clean-up-your-websites/">guest post</a> on <a href="http://venturebeat.com/">VentureBeat</a> on the topic of a good <acronym>VC</acronym> website design and content. As someone who has—since 1995—been fascinated by web design and effective communication and who used to design websites for organizations as a hobby, this guest post struck a chord in me. Being opinionated and having good aesthetic tastes, I thought I would add my opinion on what makes for a good <acronym>PE</acronym>/<acronym>VC</acronym> website, classified according to whether the opinion relates to “design” or “content”.</p>

## Design

### Typography Matters 

In the primordial days of the web, when web typography was circumscribed to a limited number of “web safe” fonts,<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> there was not a lot that one could do about choosing appropriate fonts to convey one’s message and brand. These days, however, a range of font subscription services such as [Typekit](https://typekit.com/), [Cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/), [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/), and [Fontdeck](http://fontdeck.com/) permit you (or your designer) to be far more creative in your choice of fonts.



## Content 

### Pithy Pitch

Venture capitalists, more than private equity investors, tend to demand that entrepreneurs give pithy, memorable one or two sentence descriptions of their startups. These descriptions should distill the essence of the startup, what it stands for and what differentiates it from its competitors. In light of that, it seems entirely reasonable that <acronym>VC</acronym> firms should be evaluated on the same metric: can they give a pithy, memorable one or two sentence description of what their firm stands for?

The best <acronym>PE</acronym>/<acronym>VC</acronym> sites should make it clear, from the start, what the firm is about.

An example of a very succinct but distinctive tagline or slogan for a <acronym>VC</acronym> firm is:
