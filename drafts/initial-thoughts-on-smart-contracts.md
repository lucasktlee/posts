As those who either follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucasKTLee) or have read my thoughts on [blockchain’s potential](http://lucasktlee.com/2015/05/28/blockchains-potential/) may already know, I have been fascinated by applications of the blockchain for a while now, even if my enthusiasm for Bitcoin as a currency remains somewhat muted. 

In my last blog post on the blockchain, I mentioned briefly [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), a very interesting and ambitious project to provide a _generalized_ platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum is _not_ built on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) blockchain,<sup><a href="fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> although it draws on the concepts of decentralized consensus and cryptographic proof used in Bitcoin. Instead, Ethereum is built upon its own decentralized transaction ledger (an application of the blockchain paradigm) and uses its own currency, Ether, to incentivize miners on its blockchain. Moreover, Ethereum has a built-in Turing-complete<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> programming language, which allows programmers to create applications or “smart contracts” with arbitrarily defined rules for ownership, transactions, and transitions from one state to another. 

One of Ethereum’s great strengths (and weaknesses) is its degree of _abstraction._ Bitcoin is a _cryptocurrency,_ a method of transferring value from one party to another. While projects exist that have grafted on additional functionality to Bitcoin by encode such functionality through Bitcoin’s native scripting language,<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> this involves making use of something that was initially designed to do one thing (transferring value) to do another thing (). 

This is likely to be a little too abstract for most readers; I needed to re-read the [yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf) written by [Dr. Gavin Wood](https://twitter.com/gavofyork) with careful attention to every word to grasp it. 

Let me provide a real world example:

In practice, it means a programming language that can express any computation that can conceivably be carried out (assuming, for this purpose, infinite time and memory). <a href="#fref02">&#8593;</a></li>
        <li id="fn03">This is, by design, not a Turing-complete programming language. The Bitcoin scripting language resembles <a href="http://www.forth.com/forth/">Forth</a>, and is very compact. <a href="#fref03">&#8593;</a></li>
