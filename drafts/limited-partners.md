<p class="lede">As I <a href="http://lucasktlee.com/2014/08/28/introduction-to-private-equity-fund-terms/">previously mentioned</a>, a private equity or venture capital fund is a pool of capital provided by investors, typically called limited partners (<abbr>LP</abbr>s) in light of the fact that private equity and venture capital funds are often structured as limited partnerships. Understanding who <abbr>LP</abbr>s are and what they want is important for any fund sponsor that wishes to raise a fund, because <abbr>LP</abbr>s are, in the immortal words of the exquisite Vesper Lynd, <q>the money.</q></p>

Here I will provide a brief overview of the categories of investors that a fund sponsor will typically seek to be <abbr>LP</abbr>s in their fund, and some observations about the characteristics, interests, and concerns of these <abbr>LP</abbr>s. It will serve as a primer to some of the considerations—including some legal considerations arising from the <cite>Investment Advisers Act of 1940</cite> (the **“AA”**) and the <cite>Investment Company Act of 1940</cite> (the **“ICA”**)—that anyone involved in the industry ought to consider when dealing with fundraising for a <abbr title="private equity">PE</abbr>/<abbr title="venture capital">VC</abbr> fund that is subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations.

## Who are the limited partners?

### The fund sponsor’s perspective

Let us first look at the choice of limited partners from the perspective of the fund sponsor, since it is the fund sponsor that decides to whom the fund should be marketed. In general, the fund sponsor will take into account—without limitation—two key considerations when determining what kind of investors to approach: 

* Avoid registration of the limited partnership interests of the fund with the U.S. <abbr title="Securities and Exchange Commission">SEC</abbr>.
* Qualify for an exemption to the <abbr title="Investment Advisers Act of 1940">AA</abbr> restriction on performance fees. 

First, limited partnership interests in a <abbr>PE</abbr>/<abbr>VC</abbr> fund are “securities”, as such term is broadly defined in the <cite>Securities Act of 1933</cite> (the **“SA”**). Such limited partnership interest, as a “security”, must be registered with the <abbr>SEC</abbr> unless it falls within an exemption. A fund sponsor will want to avoid registering the limited partnership interests of the fund with the <abbr>SEC</abbr> because registration is costly, public disclosures can compromise the fund’s ability to execute its investment strategy, and ongoing compliance obligations are onerous. Accordingly, most fund sponsors will try to conduct a private placement of their fund’s limited partnership interests pursuant to section 4(2) of the <abbr title="Securities Act of 1933">SA</abbr>, typically by complying with the safe harbor guidelines of Regulation D. As a general rule, fund sponsors rely on Rule 506(b) of Regulation D, which allow a fund sponsor to sell its limited partnership interests to an unlimited number<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> of “accredited investors” (a term defined in Regulation D that we will come back to in a moment) and up to 35 non-accredited investors. 

Accredited investors means 

A fund sponsor will want to charge performance fees, better known in private equity and venture capital as “carried interest”. For a fund sponsor to do so, the fund must either be

        <li id="fn01">Unlimited is, of course, a bit of an exaggeration. Fund sponsors will want to limited the number of investors in their fund to ensure that they do not fall under section 12(g) of the <cite>Securities Exchange Act of 1934</cite>, which requires registration of securities of a domestic issuer with more than $10 million in total assets and the securities of which are held by 500 or more persons. Moreover, most fund sponsors will want to limit their investors to a manageable number, since additional investors impose incremental costs—in time and resources—on the fund sponsor. <a href="#fref01">&#8593;</a></li>
