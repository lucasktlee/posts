<p class="lede">As I <a href="http://lucasktlee.com/2014/08/28/introduction-to-private-equity-fund-terms/">previously mentioned</a>, a private equity or venture capital fund is a pool of capital provided by investors, typically called limited partners or <abbr>LP<abbr>s in light of the fact that private equity and venture capital funds are often structured as limited partnerships. </p>

A <abbr>LP</abbr>, speaking candidly, would say, in the immortal words of Vesper Lynd, <q>Iâ€™m the money.</q>
