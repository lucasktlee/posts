<p class="lede">One of the more interesting questions that I sometimes ponder, when the night is long and a tumbler of Yamasaki 12-year is in my hand, is, <em>What technologies currently under development will be truly disruptive?</em> I do not pretend to have a crystal ball; as a student of the history of innovation I am painfully aware that predictions from even the most brilliant experts generally have almost no correlation with reality. But having criticized others for their predictions in my conversations with friends, it is only fair that I open myself to the same scrutiny by setting down in writing my thoughts on the topic, which I have done on this May 2, 2015. I will revisit this topic with an “annual review” twelve months from today to see whether these technologies have progressed in the direction I predicted and a new set of thoughts on what technologies I think are worth looking into.</p>

First, one caveat. I am not looking at technologies purely from the perspective of a venture capitalist trying to select viable investment opportunities. I am looking at technologies that can change the world in a non-incremental fashion, regardless of whether they are technologies that are best financed by <abbr>VC</abbr> investments. 

## It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future  

I recently had the pleasure of hearing [Andrew Chung](https://twitter.com/achung) speak at Wharton, and one comment he made stuck with me: Predicting the future by extrapolating from the past (and present)—the way many intelligent people, especially those trained in business school, management consulting firms, or investment banks, do—is foolish. It is, however, an entirely too common practice.

So, first, let’s look at the famously wrong predictions of some of the experts.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</sup> 

First, the telephone.

> The Telephone purports to transmit the speaking voice over telegraph wires. We found that the voice is very weak and 
> indistinct, and grows even weaker when long wires are used between the transmitter and receiver. Technically, we do 
> not see that this device will be ever capable of sending recognizable speech over a distance of several miles. 
> Messer Hubbard and Bell want to install one of their “telephone devices” in every city. The idea is idiotic on the 
> face of it. Furthermore, why would any person want to use this ungainly and impractical device when he can send a 
> messenger to the telegraph office and have a clear written message sent to any large city in the United States?
> 
> The electricians of our company have developed all the significant improvements in the telegraph art to date, and we 
> see no reason why a group of outsiders, with extravagant and impractical ideas, should be entertained, when they have 
> not the slightest idea of the true problems involved. Mr. G.G. Hubbard’s fanciful predictions, while they sound rosy, 
> are based on wild-eyed imagination and lack of understanding of the technical and economic facts of the situation, 
> and a posture of ignoring the obvious limitations of his device, which is hardly more than a toy&#8230;.
>
> In view of these facts, we feel that Mr. G.G. Hubbard’s request for $100,000 of the sale of this patent is utterly 
> unreasonable, since this device is inherently of no use to us. We do not recommend its purchase.

The telephone eventually replaced the telegraph as the primary means of communication across great distances. I don’t think anyone born in a developed country after the 1980s has ever had the occasion to use a telegraph to send messages.

Second, airplanes. 

> Heavier than air flying machines are impossible. 
> <footer><cite>A statement made in 1895 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin">The Right Honourable Lord Kelvin</a>, <abbr title="Order of Merit">OM</abbr> <abbr title="Knight of the Grand Cross, Royal Victorian Order">GCVO</abbr> <abbr title="Privy Counsellor">PC</abbr> <abbr title="President of the Royal Society">PRS</abbr> <abbr title="President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh">PRSE</abbr></cite></footer>

On December 17, 1903, as we well know, the Wright Brothers made the first controlled, powered and sustainable flight with a heavier than air vehicle. The rest is, as they say, history. 

Third, computers. 

> Originally one thought that if there were a half dozen large computers in this country, hidden away in research 
> laboratories, this would take care of all requirements we had throughout the country.
> <footer><cite>A statement made in 1952 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken">Howard H. Aiken</a></cite></footer>

Based on data from Enders Analysis, in 2013 the installed base of personal computers in the world was more than 1.5 billion. Assuming that there are 200 countries (which is undoubtedly an overestimation given that this statement was made in 1952), each with six computers per Aiken’s statement, that would be 1,200 computers worldwide. He was off by almost 1 million times.

In short, even some of the smartest people in the world can be wrong when they make predictions about the future, because they base their predictions on what is currently known. All too often, that leads to largely “linear” extrapolations that fail to understand that truly disruptive, non-incremental innovations completely upend everything we think we know about the state of at least one part of the world.

## Thoughts on Technologies

So, without further ado, here are the technologies that I think are potentially disruptive. I tend to think in terms of broad trends rather than specific applications or companies. 

### Energy

One of the biggest problems facing humankind is the provision of 

#### Advanced Nuclear Fission Reactors  



[Transatomic Power](http://transatomicpower.com/), which received $5.5 million in three rounds of seed funding from a group of investors including Peter Thiel, Daniel Aegerter, the [Founders Fund](http://foundersfund.com/), and FF Science. 

#### Net-Positive Nuclear Fusion Reactors

[Helion](http://www.helionenergy.com/), which received $1.5 million in seed funding from Peter Thiel’s [Mithril Capital Management](http://www.mithril.com/) and [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/)

        <li id="fn01">By experts, I refer not to consultants of any stripe, but to scientists, intellectuals, and founders of successful businesses. Taking potshots at consultants and sell-side analysts is entirely too simple given that their predictions about the future are generally no more useful for decision-making than employing a blindfolded monkey to throw darts at a decision board. <a href="#fref01">&#8593;</a></li>
