<p class="lede">In 2015, I wrote a post detailing my thoughts on certain disruptive technologies that might change the world in the next decade or two. It seems appropriate, now, to revisit this topic.</p>

## Reflecting on 2015

Before I proceed to discuss my thoughts in 2016, it is appropriate to first revisit what I wrote in 2015. I mentioned three broad categories:

* Novel energy sources and supporting infrastructure
* High-temperature superconductors
* Artificial general intelligence

What has happened in each of these categories since I wrote that post?

### Novel energy sources and supporting infrastructure

Within this category, I identified three sub-categories as being the most potentially disruptive (but also the most difficult):

* Advanced nuclear fission reactors
* Net-positive self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactors
* Novel energy storage technologies

#### Advanced nuclear fission reactors



#### Net-positive self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactors

#### Novel energy storage technologies

### High-temperature superconductors

### Artificial general intelligence
