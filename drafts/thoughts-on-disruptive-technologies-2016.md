<p class="lede">In 2015, I wrote a post detailing my thoughts on certain disruptive technologies that might change the world in the next decade or two. It seems appropriate, now, to revisit this topic.</p>

## Reflecting on 2015

Before I proceed to discuss my thoughts in 2016, it is appropriate to first revisit what I wrote in 2015. I mentioned three broad categories:

* Novel energy sources and supporting infrastructure
* High-temperature superconductors
* Artificial general intelligence

What has happened in each of these categories since I wrote that post?

### Novel energy sources and supporting infrastructure

Within this category, I identified three sub-categories as being the most potentially disruptive (but also the most difficult):

* Advanced nuclear fission reactors
* Net-positive self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactors
* Novel energy storage technologies

#### Advanced nuclear fission reactors



#### Net-positive self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactorsCenovus Energy (a Canadian oil company in Alberta)

I did not expect much to happen in one year—commercially viable fusion reactors are a decades-long endeavor—but there were some promising developments in 2015.

Canadian startup [General Fusion](http://www.generalfusion.com/), founded in 2002 by [Dr. Michel Laberge](https://www.ted.com/speakers/michel_laberge) received $27 million in venture capital funding from a syndicate led by [Khazanah Nasional](http://www.khazanah.com.my), a strategic investment fund of the government of Malaysia.<sup><a href="" id=""></a></sup> General Fusion is pursuing a form of fusion technology called magnetized target fusion, in which magnetic fields are used to confine the fusion fuel while it is heated into a plasma before steam-driven pistons are used to compress the plasma to initiate fusion. The basic technology—with a different compression mechanism—was first tested in 2001 at the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://lanl.gov/).<sup><a href="" id=""></a></sup>

## Thoughts for 2016

There are a few areas that I have begun to look at

    <li id="fn">By contrast, traditional nuclear research has focused on two competing methods of initiating fusion: magnetic confinement fusion and inertial confinement fusion. <a href="#fref">&#8593;</a></li>
