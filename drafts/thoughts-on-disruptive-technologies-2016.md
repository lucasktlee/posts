<p class="lede">In 2015, I wrote a post detailing my thoughts on certain disruptive technologies that might change the world in the next decade or two. It seems appropriate, now, to revisit this topic.</p>

## Reflecting on 2015

Before I proceed to discuss my thoughts in 2016, it is appropriate to first revisit what I wrote in 2015. I mentioned three broad categories:

* Novel energy sources and supporting infrastructure
* High-temperature superconductors
* Artificial general intelligence

What has happened in each of these categories since I wrote that post?

### Novel energy sources and supporting infrastructure

Within this category, I identified three sub-categories as being the most potentially disruptive (but also the most difficult):

* Advanced nuclear fission reactors
* Net-positive self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactors
* Novel energy storage technologies

#### Advanced nuclear fission reactors

I did not expect much to happen in one year—commercially viable advanced nuclear fission reactors are at least five to ten years away from production.

I have [revisited](https://lucasktlee.com/2015/12/27/some-thoughts-on-nuclear-energy-startups/) the topic of advanced nuclear fission reactors after attending the  [<abbr>MIT</abbr> Technology Review EmTech 2015](http://www.technologyreview.com/emtech/15/) conference in November 2015, and will not spend too much time repeating what I said regarding the challenges faced by some of the nuclear fission startups.

Perhaps the most significant development in 2015 was the establishment of the [Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear](https://gain.inl.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx) program at the [U.S. Department of Energy](http://energy.gov/), which aims to <q>provide the nuclear energy community with access to the technical, regulatory, and financial support necessary to move new or advanced nuclear reactor designs toward commercialization.</q> I’ve previously noted that regulatory hurdles and costs pose a problem for commercializing the advanced nuclear fission reactors being developed at the 45 nuclear reactor projects<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> in North America. This program provides a single point of government and regulatory contact for American nuclear technology developers, as well as assistance navigating the regulatory process to obtain approval for their designs.

In principle, <abbr title="Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear">GAIN</abbr> should ease the process of obtaining regulatory approvals, access to laboratory space, materials, data, and people. In practice, it remains to be seen exactly how helpful this program will be for nuclear startups and technology developers at larger institutions and corporations.



#### Net-positive self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactors

I did not expect much to happen in one year—commercially viable fusion reactors are a decades-long endeavor—but there were some promising developments in 2015.

Canadian startup [General Fusion](http://www.generalfusion.com/), founded in 2002 by [Dr. Michel Laberge](https://www.ted.com/speakers/michel_laberge) received $27 million in venture capital funding from a syndicate led by [Khazanah Nasional](http://www.khazanah.com.my/), a strategic investment fund of the government of Malaysia in May 2015.<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> General Fusion is pursuing a form of fusion technology called magnetized target fusion, in which magnetic fields are used to confine the fusion fuel while it is heated into a plasma before steam-driven pistons are used to compress the plasma to initiate fusion. The basic technology—with a different compression mechanism—was first tested in 2001 at the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://lanl.gov/).<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup>

[Helion Energy](http://www.helionenergy.com/) raised $10.6 million in July 2015 from undisclosed investors. Helion is pursuing a form of fusion technology called magneto-inertial fusion where magnetic fields are used to compress the fuel—in plasma form—to fusion pressure and temperatures. Helion had previously received seed funding from Peter Thiel’s [Mithril Capital Management](http://www.mithril.com/) and [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

[Tri Alpha Energy](http://www.trialphaenergy.com/)—backed by Microsoft co-founder [Paul Allen](https://twitter.com/PaulGAllen), Goldman Sachs, Venrock, and Rusnano (a Russian government-backed investment company)—has also reportedly managed to sustain plasma at 10 million degrees Celsius<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup> for 5µs.<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fref05">5</a></sup>

In Germany, in December 2015, scientists at the [Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics](http://www.ipp.mpg.de/2285/en/) have achieved helium plasma temperatures of 1 million degrees Celsius with a [stellarator](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/2815279/technologie) design, the Wendelstein 7-X.

At [<abbr>MIT</abbr>](http://web.mit.edu), a team of scientists at the Plasma Science nad Fusion Center, harnessing recent developments in supercondcutive materials, has proposed a smaller reactor that could equal the power of the proposed <abbr>ITER</abbr> reactor in France at half the size and a fraction of the cost.<sup><a href="" id=""></a></sup>

I will state my general concerns with nuclear fusion startups first. First, despite what [William D. Lese](http://www.braemarenergy.com/team/bios/lese.html), a managing partner at [Braemar Energy Ventures](http://www.braemarenergy.com/)—an investor in General Fusion—[says](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/technology/start-ups-take-on-challenge-of-nuclear-fusion.html) about the fusion era being here and coming, fusion has always been the technology of the future. History is littered with the remains of broken promises on fusion energy. The ideas that many of the current crop of fusion startups are exploring were the ideas that were discarded in the 1970s when government and academic research opted to focus on the [tokamak](http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/tokamak.aspx) and laser-based inertial confinement fusion, such as magnetized target fusion, and field reversed configuration fusion. There is a non-trivial chance that these ideas will not succeed now, either. Indeed, some physicists have already criticized these startups for <q>pounding on the same dead horse</q>.

Now, to be fair, there is no reason to believe that these alternatives to the traditional tokamak and inertial confinement fusion designs are not worthy of revisiting, particularly in light of advances in relevant fields, including raw computing power, plasma physics, magnetodynamics, and materials sciences. Indeed, I tend to believe that modern scientific and technological advancements may open new avenues that were previously closed not due to a problem with the basic science, but due to technical limits. (Consider, for example, that a top of the line <abbr title="Control Data Corporation">CDC</abbr> 6600 supercomputer in the 1960s could manage around 3<abbr>MFLOPS</abbr>; in 2015, the Apple A9 processor in the iPhone 6S can manage 172.8<abbr>GFLOPS</abbr> (57,600 times the floating point computational power of the <abbr>CDC</abbr> 6600), and top of the line supercomputers in 2016 can achieve more than 90<abbr>PFLOPS</abbr> (31 billion times the floating point computational power of the <abbr>CDC</abbr> 6600). There are a _lot_ of things we take for granted now that would have been impossible to do on _any_ computer system in the 1960s.)

My second concern lies with the question of whether these startups are promising too much. Recall, if you will, the promise—in the 1950s and 1960s—that general nuclear fusion was only twenty years away, and the long winter that occurred after those promising avenues failed and government funding dried up. We have Helion Energy claiming to be able to build a modular, truck-sized 50<abbr>MW</abbr> fusion reactor. General Fusion’s design is likewise small, with an approximately 3 meters in diameter spherical reaction chamber and some 300 pneumatic pistons to create the compression wave. Tri Alpha Energy is pursuing a hydrogen-boron reactor that would require achieving plasma temperatures in the range of 3 billion degrees Celsius but would avoid many of the neutron radiation problems of deuterium-tritium fusion reactions.<sup><a href="#fn06" id="fref06">6</a></sup> Each of these startups faces significant technological challenges, and it may well be that their early successes may not continue.

My third concern is with the often _limited_ holding period of conventional venture capital funds: given a lifespan of between ten to twelve years, these funds may not have the ability to stay invested in these startups through the time it will take for them to achieve commercial viability. This is not a problem that sovereign wealth funds and government-backed strategic investment or development funds face, and may give such funds an advantage in investing in long-term technological developments.

On the whole though, I tend to favor the premise of experimenting with diverse approaches to creating commercially viable fusion reactors. These startups may fail at some point in the future, but their failures will nevertheless advance the state of knowledge of commercially viable nuclear fusion.

#### Novel energy storage technologies

Novel energy storage technologies mostly remain in the laboratory, as of the end of 2015.

### High-temperature superconductors

High-temperature superconductors mostly remain in the laboratory, as of the end of 2015.

### Artificial general intelligence

Artificial general intelligence is another multi-year (if not multi-decade) endeavor.

In March 2016, [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/alpha-go.html) became the first computer program to ever beat a professional player at [go](http://www.usgo.org/files/pdf/W2Go4E-book.pdf) (围棋).

There are a few areas that I have begun to look at, in addition to what
