<p class="lede">On March 25, 2015, the <abbr title="Securities and Exchange Commission">SEC</abbr> released its final amendments to Regulation A under the <cite>Securities Act of 1933</cite> (the <strong>“SA”</strong>), which implements Title IV of the <cite>Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act</cite> (the <strong>“JOBS Act”</strong>). As I had already written <a href="http://lucasktlee.com/2014/08/02/the-problems-with-equity-crowdfunding/">my thoughts</a> on the implementing regulations for <cite>Title III</cite> of the <abbr>JOBS</abbr> Act, it seems fitting to bring the same analysis to the newly promulgated Regulation A+.</p>

The starting point for the sale of securities—broadly defined to include equity and debt instruments, investment contracts, certificates of deposit, securities index, participation rights in a profit-sharing agreement, interests in mineral rights, derivatives, and interests in investment funds howsoever organized<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup>—in the United States is the prohibition in the <abbr title="Securities Act of 1933">SA</abbr> on offering or selling any security sold using the instruments of interstate commerce unless such security is registered with the <abbr>SEC</abbr> or is exempted from registration. 

One such exemption from registration under the <abbr>SA</abbr> was Regulation A, which the <abbr>SEC</abbr> first adopted in 1936 and updated periodically to increase the maximum amount that investors could raise using this exemption (the current limit, prior to the 2015 amendments, was $5 million). Based on [data](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2013/33-9497.pdf) from the SEC, Regulation A was not a popular exemption: there were only 19 Regulation A offerings in the period from 2009 to 2012 with a total offering amount of $73 million, compared to 27,500 Regulation D offerings of up to $5 million each (at or below the maximum size of a Regulation A offering) during the same period.

Why was Regulation A so unpopular? To understand this, we need to examine the terms of Regulation A, and how it affected issuers seeking to offer securities under this exemption. 

## The old Regulation A

First, let us summarize the relevant provisions of Regulation A.
