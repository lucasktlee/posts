<p class="lede">On March 25, 2015, the <abbr title="Securities and Exchange Commission">SEC</abbr> released its final amendments to Regulation A under the <cite>Securities Act of 1933</cite> (the <strong>“SA”</strong>), which implements Title IV of the <cite>Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act</cite> (the <strong>“JOBS Act”</strong>). As I had already written <a href="http://lucasktlee.com/2014/08/02/the-problems-with-equity-crowdfunding/">my thoughts</a> on the implementing regulations for <cite>Title III</cite> of the <abbr>JOBS</abbr> Act, it seems fitting to bring the same analysis to the newly promulgated Regulation A+.</p>
