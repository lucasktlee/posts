Many private equity, real estate, and infrastructure fund sponsors offer co-investment opportunities to limited partners in their funds. The practice of offering co-investment opportunities to limited partners has been an accepted part of the industry since well before I joined it in 2008.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> The appetite for co-investments among limited partners—particularly certain large and sophisticated institutional investors with the resources to build in-house direct investment expertise—has grown since the 2008 global financial crisis. Indeed, some large institutional investors have go so far as to begin building in-house private equity investment teams that independently invest in transactions.<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup>

I find the co-investment space interesting for a number of reasons. 

## Why Co-investments?

This question can be addressed from two perspectives, that of the fund sponsor and that of the institutional investor. For a co-investment relationship to work, both fund sponsor and institutional investor must feel that they gain a benefit from the relationship. 

First, I will look at the reasons why a fund sponsor may elect to offer co-investments to its limited partners or other private equity firms. (Bear in mind that the following reasons are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive.)

* **Need for additional capital to make the investment:** Recall that most private equity, real estate, and infrastructure funds will have concentration limitations that prohibit the fund from investing more than a stipulated amount of the fund’s capital in a single investment.<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> If a fund wishes to make an investment that would be larger than its concentration limits would permit, it can either seek approval from its advisory committee for this exceptionally large investment, or it can seek co-investors for the excess. Advisory commitees will often be reluctant to approve investments that greatly increase the fund’s concentration risk, and thus the only realistic option for the fund sponsor may be to seek co-investors. 
* **Fill gaps in the capital structure of an investment:** Where access to debt financing is constrained or available only on prohibitive terms, a fund sponsor may instead elect to offer part of an investment to co-investors. 
* **Goodwill with investors:** A fund sponsor may seek to secure a prospective investor’s commitment to its fund by offering co-investment opportunities, typically on a no fee and no carry basis, to that prospective investor. This can allow a fund sponsor to build or retain a relationship with an investor that is willing to re-up when the fund sponsor begins raising a successor fund. One example of this, from my experience with [Partners Group](http://www.partnersgroup.com/) in Asia, was where a first-time real estate fund sponsor in Asia—which shall remain unnamed for confidentiality reasons—was willing to offer co-investment opportunities to large, credible institutional investors willing to commit a minimum amount to its first close. The co-investment opportunities were a method of encouraging such investors to commit to its first close and generate much needed momentum and credibility for subsequent closes.
* **Strategic value-add for the portfolio company:** A fund sponsor may offer a co-investment opportunity to a strategic investor in the same industry as the portfolio company to tap into the strategic investor’s industry expertise and contacts. A strategic investor that co-invests in a portfolio company may also be a potential buyer for the fund’s stake in the portfolio company at some point in the future. The fund sponsor may also offer the co-investment opportunity to an institutional investor with an extensive network in a region or industry where the portfolio company has expansion plans to tap that investor’s network of contacts and regional expertise. 
* **Avoiding the potential conflict among fund sponsors associated with a club deal:** In a club deal where an investment is acquired by multiple fund sponsors working in concert, there is a real risk that the fund sponsors will come into conflict over post-investment operational improvements, bolt-on acquisitions, or exit opportunities. As a general rule, co-investors are less likely to come into conflict with a fund sponsor over such matters, particularly where the co-investors are limited partners in the fund sponsor’s fund, as they have already approved the general investment and value-add approach of the fund sponsor. In my experience with co-investments at Partners Group, the level of involvement of a co-investor can range from active, regular involvement in decision-making at the portfolio company through a seat on the board of directors, to a hands-off approach with all decision-making handled by the fund sponsor that led the investment.
* **Relationship building with other fund sponsors:** A fund sponsor may offer a co-investment opportunity to another fund sponsor if the second fund sponsor has special skill or expertise in the industry or region. As an example, drawing again from my experience, an Indian private equity fund sponsor invited another global private equity fund sponsor to co-invest in the operator of a chain of private schools in India due to the global fund sponsor’s prior investments in the education sector and its potential to introduce the portfolio company to contacts in the education sector in Europe. 

There are a number of reasons why institutional investors elect to pursue co-investments or direct investments. (Bear in mind that the following reasons are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive.)

* **Exposure to deal-making and acquisition of direct investing skills:** The institutional investor may wish to develop its ability to make direct investments in the future, and view co-investments with extensive and deep involvement in the acquisition process and post-acquisition operational improvements as a method of gaining much needed experience prior to building out its own direct investment practice. This approach has been taken by fund-of-funds managers, sovereign wealth funds, and large pension plans. Indeed, one can say that Partners Group began as a fund-of-funds manager in the 1990s, added co-investments, and eventually migrated to direct investing as a sole investor or lead investor in the late 2000s. This was certainly my experience at Partners Group from 2008 to 2014, when the direct investing practice was in its early growth phase. 
* **Accelerated deployment of capital compared to fund investments:** An institutional investor that invests in a private equity, real estate or infrastructure fund commits capital to the fund at the time it signs its subscription agreement. The fund sponsor will then call capital on an as needed basis to fund investments in portfolio companies. Depending on the investment pace of the fund sponsor, it can take several years for the majority of the capital to be deployed in investments or reserved for follow-on investments.<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup> By contrast, capital committed to co-investments is fully deployed at closing or within a relatively short period of time after closing. This allows the institutional investor to control the pace of their capital deployment.
* **Improve returns:** A co-investment by an institutional investor that is a limited partner in a fund sponsor’s fund is frequently made on a no fee no carry basis. <i lang="la">Ceteris paribus</i>, an investment accessed through a co-investment will deliver higher returns (net of fees) than the same investment accessed through a fund charging the usual 2% management fee and 20% carried interest. Even where management fees and carry are charged (typically on co-investment funds managed by a fund sponsor), the amount charged will often be significantly lower: often in the range of 1% management fee and 10% carried interest. Moreover, the investment opportunities offered for co-investment are typically at least of decent quality given their importance as a relationship building tool for fund sponsors.

## Co-investments — A Bespoke Process 

How does an institutional investor get access to co-investment opportunities with a fund sponsor? The negotiations for access to co-investments will often begin at the time the institutional investor decides to make a capital commitment to the fund sponsor’s fund, i.e. during the fundraising process. The fund sponsor will often have made a determination—in consultation with its counsel—on whether to offer co-investment opportunities at all and if it decides to do so, how to document it; whether in the limited partnership agreement of the fund and side letters issued by the fund to certain investors, or in the form of an oral agreement to offer suitable co-investment opportunities to certain investors. 

In my experience, the trend among fund sponsors to is to explicitly document in the limited partnership agreement of the fund their discretion to offer co-investment opportunities to limited partners of the fund and third parties, such as the following example from a pan-Asia buyout fund: 

> To the extent to which part of an investment opportunity remains available 
> following determination of the amounts to be invested by the Partnership
> in an Investment in accordance with this Agreement then the General Partner 
> may offer (but is under no obligation to do so) all or part of such 
> investment opportunity to Limited Partners, the members of the board of 
> directors and employees of Portfolio Companies, and such other persons
> as the General Partner may in its discretion decide.

The level of detail in the co-investment provision of a limited partnership agreement can vary from fund to fund. The example I've quoted is fairly light on details. I have seen examples that specified the order in which co-investment opportunities must be offered to different categories of co-investors, and specifying the general terms on which such co-investments must be made, and the general terms on which the fund and the co-investors must disposed of such co-investments.

## Lessons Learned from Six Years of Co-investing  

At Partners Group, I worked on [*] co-investments in Europe and Asia from 2008 to 2014. I should state here that the skillset required to make successful co-investments is subtly different from the skillset required to make successful direct investments or fund investments.

## Conclusion 



<div class="footnotes">
    <ol>
        <li id="fn01">I recall that at least some of the co-investments in <a href="http://www.partnersgroup.com/">Partners Group</a>’s portfolio were made in 2006 and grew out of the firm’s beginnings as a fund-of-funds manager. <a href="#fref01">&#8593;</a></li>
        <li id="fn02">These include the <a href="http://www.china-inv.cn/">China Investment Corporation</a>, the <a href="http://www.cppib.com/en/home.html">CPP Investment Board</a>, and the <a href="http://www.otpp.com/">Ontario Teachers Pension Plan</a>. <a href="#fref02">&#8593;</a></li>
        <li id="fn03">The concentration limit is typically specified as a <em>percentage</em> of the fund’s aggregate capital commitments. Thus, a private equity fund with $1,000 million in aggregate capital commitments and a 20% concentration limit would be permitted to invest no more than $200 million in a single portfolio company. <a href="#fref03">&#8593;</a></li>
        <li id="fn04">I am aware that some Chinese venture capital funds such as <a href=""></a> have fully invested (with likely substantial reserves for follow-on investments) their committed capital within very short periods of time, but such funds should be considered as outliers in the global venture capital industry. <a href="#fref04">&#8593;</a></li>
