<p class="lede">I first read <cite>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</cite> as the age of 15, in the Harvard Classics edition of 1909 – 1914, as translated by George Long. I can vividly recall discovering the book in my father‘s book collection from his days as a graduate student in the United States: the scent of leather and the slightly musty smell of the—long unread—pages. I did not realize, then, that I was embarking on a philosophical journey that would shape, in part, the man that I am today.

If—after reading these thoughts on Marcus Aurelius—you would like to read <cite>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</cite> for yourself, I recommend the [Gregory Hays](http://amzn.to/1JBcIfC) translation.
