<p class="lede">The <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> community has long viewed the online payment system as a decentralized digital currency. Yet there remains some debate as to whether Bitcoin is “money”, or just a “payment protocol”, a distinction that has certain legal rammifications. Moreover, some <abbr>VC</abbr>s, including <a href="http://www.avc.com/">Fred Wilson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jmonegro">Joel Monegro</a> of <a href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a>, believe that the underlying blockchain protocol that powers Bitcoin may be its most significant contribution to the future of internet applications. More recently, the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/">MIT Technology Review</a> published an <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/537246/why-bitcoin-could-be-much-more-than-a-currency/">article</a> detailing the uses of the blockchain outside of pure Bitcoin transactions. Like the partners at Union Square Ventures, I see the blockchain as a potentially more interesting technology than the Bitcoin “payment protocol”, for reasons that I will detail below.</p>

This post will begin with a brief [history](#history) of Bitcoin, progress to a summary of my views on Bitcoin as [money](#money), and conclude with my views on the blockchain as an [enabling protocol](#ep). 

<h2 id="history">A Brief History of Bitcoin</h2>

Bitcoin began in October 2008 with a [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) written by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> A quarter later, in January 2009, he released the first version of the Bitcoin software. Interest in the software remained fairly muted until around the end of 2010, when the value of a Bitcoin began to appreciate rapidly. For an understanding of how rapidly Bitcoin has appreciated, we can draw on price data from [CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/): from approximately $0.0858 per Bitcoin on July 18, 2010, the price of Bitcoins rose to an all time high of $1124.7631 per Bitcoin on November 30, 2013. The price did, of course, collapse thereafter, falling to $239.63 per Bitcoin on May 10, 2015.



The first known Bitcoin transaction for a physical good was made on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz bought a pizza for 10,000 Bitcoins. In the years since, Bitcoin has seen 

Bitcoin has been surprisingly free from significant vulnerabilities. Indeed, the only known major exploit of a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol occurred on August 15, 2010, when someone exploited a weakness in the code used to check transactions to create 184 billion Bitcoins and send them to two addresses. This flaw was subsequently patched, and the Bitcoin blockchain updated to eliminate the transaction.<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</a></sup> 

However, there have been some other glitches that resulted in forks to the Bitcoin blockchain, including one on March 12, 2013, which resulted from the creation of an invalid block on the blockchain by a miner running the latest version of the Bitcoin software. 

Bitcoin has been mired in a number of controversies since its inception. Notably, its anonymity made it the payment protocol of choice for the [Silk Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)) online black market, which was primarily used for drug transactions. This has c

There have also been a number of highly publicized failures of Bitcoin exchanges, including the bankruptcy of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange (which at its height handled some 70% of all Bitcoin transactions) in February 2014.

<h2 id="money">Bitcoin as Money</h2>

First, let us look at the economic definition of “money”: an item that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayments of debts. It performs three functions: a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. Currency, which is sometimes used to describe Bitcoin, is defined as a generally accepted form of money which is issued by a government and circulated within an economy.

Even a very cursory examination of the extant literature reveals that there has been no shortage of conflicting views about whether Bitcoin is a currency:

        <li id="fn01">This is not the place to speculate on the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Enough ink has already been spilled—physically and virtually—on this topic. Suffice it to say, I do believe, based on the evidence so far presented, that Satoshi Nakamoto is either a very talented individual or a team of highly talented individuals working in concert. <a href="#fref01">&#8593;</a></li>
        <li id="fn02">Unfortunately, while the Bitcoin protocol itself has remained largely free of significant exploits, individual Bitcoin “wallets” have been subject to numerous hacks and data losses. <a href="#fref02">&#8593;</a></li>
