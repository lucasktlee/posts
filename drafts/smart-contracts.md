<p class="lede">So-called “smart contracts” are an increasingly active area of technological development in the blockchain and decentralized applications space, with platforms such as <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="http://counterparty.io/">Counterparty</a>, <a href="http://symbiont.io/">Symbiont</a>, <a href="https://www.t0.com/">tØ</a>, <a href="http://www.clearmatics.com/">Clearmatics</a>, and <a href="http://www.rootstock.io/">RSK</a>. They each claim to offer the possibility of <em>automating</em> certain kinds of human interactions by transferring certain digital assets automatically upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.</p>

## What is a contract? 

The proper place to begin is to define “contract” according to the principles of Anglo-American common law. A “contract” is an agreement between two or more parties where one party agrees to do (or refrain from doing) something in exchange for the other party agreeing to do (or refrain from doing) something else.<sup><a href="#fn01" id="fref01">1</a></sup> 

Contract law is at the heart of many financial instruments and business relationships. It is the legal framework that governs transactions as mundane as the sale of a pair of jeans, and as complex as a swaption.<sup><a href="#fn02" id="fref02">2</sup> It is the legal framework for, <span lang="la">inter alia</span>, employer-employee relationships, joint ventures, outsourced manufacturing arrangements, and agreements among shareholders to vote their stock in particular ways. Indeed, one can say with some degree of certainty that a market economy would not be possible without contract law or its civil law equivalents under the laws of obligations.

Contract law provides rules for determining when an agreement is intended to be a legally binding contract, interpreting the meaning of contractual terms, supplementing the expressly stated terms with implied terms,<sup><a href="#fn03" id="fref03">3</a></sup> determining when performance of the contract has occurred, and determining the appropriate steps the apparatus of the state can take to compel performance of the contract or compel a party to the contract to compensate the other party for its failure to perform its obligations under the contract. All of these rules will be familiar to my readers who are lawyers by training, and would likely bore my readers who are not lawyers by training; I will therefore refrain from describing these rules in detail. It suffices to note that contract law _evolved_ over many centuries to resolve problems faced by real people in real relationships and transactions; it represents a repository of _practical know-how_ that cannot be easily replicated from theoretical first principles and human reason.<sup><a href="#fn04" id="fref04">4</a></sup>

## What is a smart contract? 

With the legal definition of a contract in hand, it is now possible to look into the definition of a “smart contract”. This may be significantly harder than defining a contract. There is no commonly accepted definition of a “smart contract”. To quote [Peter Todd](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc), <q>no-one has a clue what a smart contract actually is, and if we did it'd need oracles.</q>

In the beginning, there was a man named [Nick Szabo](http://szabo.best.vwh.net), who developed the concept of a “smart contract”. His definition is: 

> A set of promises, including protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises. The protocols are 
> usually implemented with programs on a computer network, or in other forms of digital electronics, thus these 
> contracts are "smarter" than their paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial intelligence is implied.<sup><a href="#fn05" id="fref05">5</a></sup> 

This definition is a little abstract. My definition is: 

> A protocol to automate human interactions by translating a set of promises made by two or more parties into machine 
> executable code and that, without further human intervention, automatically executes such promises. 

Some people might add the requirement that a smart contract should run on some form of distributed ledger (blockchain). I choose not to, because it is not a necessary requirement: a smart contract could in principle be executed on _any_ Turing machine, though there would be issues of trust that might arise from running the smart contract on a computer or network owned by one of the participants or a third party. 

### A Brief History of Smart Contracts

In 1994, Nick Szabo<sup><a href="#fn07" id="fref07">7</a></sup> proposed the idea of smart contracts in an very interesting article, titled, [“Smart Contracts”](http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html). The idea of smart contracts was largely dormant until after the rise of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and blockchain technology in 2009, because prior to blockchain technology there was no platform that could be used to enforce smart contracts.

Since 2009, public interest in
